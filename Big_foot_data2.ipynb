It was obtained in the remote canyon of Bluff Creek, California, very close to the border of Del Norte County and Humboldt County. Both Patterson and Gimlin lived near Yakima, Washington. Patterson had been trying to obtain film footage of a bigfoot for many years. During the period he had also written a book entitled, \\\"Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?\\\" He hoped some decent film footage would help answer that question. In this book he calls attention to the unusually large amount of testimonial and circumstantial evidence pointing to the existence of large, forest-dwelling primate species in North America. Bob Gimlin, a highly experienced outdoorsman, was a close friend of Patterson. He accompanied Patterson on several horsepacking expeditions in pursuit of film footage. Equipped with a 16mm hand-held Kodak movie camera, the two set out in October, 1967 for a horsepacking trip in northwest California. Their search focused on the Bluff Creek area, because a number of tracks had been found there in prior years while logging roads were being built. Road construction workers had noticed large human-like footprints on the soft exposed soil of the new roads. The tracks were first reported to the press by . A local newspaper reporter came up with the name \\\"Bigfoot\\\" to describe the maker of the largest tracks. Tracks of six different individuals were repeatedly found on the new logging roads. The sizes ranged from 12.25 inches long to 17 inches long. In the early afternoon of October 20, 1967 as Patterson and Gimlin, on horseback, followed a trail in the creek bottom, they spotted a bigfoot apparently drinking from the creek. Patterson's horse reared in alarm as the bigfoot stood up and began to walk away. Both the horse and Patterson fell to the ground, with Patterson briefly pinned by the fallen horse. Patterson quickly worked himself free and grabbed his hand-held movie camera. While running toward the retreating bigfoot, Patterson shot 24 feet of film. Gimlin sat ready with his rifle in hand. Not wanting another spooked confrontation with this bigfoot, Patterson and Gimlin decided not to pursue it into the forest. At that point they felt they had the footage they came for anyway. After the footage was brought back to town and developed, a handful of investigators from the US and Canada returned to the film site and measured the tracks and other objects to help accurately gauge the size of the figure in the footage. The calculations suggested a height of 7 foot, 3.5 inches. The footprints were 14.5 inches long by 6 inches wide.\", \"SEASON\": \"Fall\"},\n",

I was only camping there for a few days on my way back from Topanga Canyon in L.A. to Oregon where I lived in the Cave Junction area. I will never forget what it looked like. It had long darkish brown hair that covered its entire body. It also had a pronounced crown in the shape of the top of his head. It looked extremely muscular. I was at least 500'away and I'm not real good at judging height anyways, so I don't know how tall it was. It walked with ease across a rocky creekbed.

He reported that the sounds we heard then are common to his experience and that he has actually seen Bigfoot families cross the road to where his house is!\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"Yes, just what I've reported above.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"I live in Humboldt Co. CA and have heard night screams that sounded like an incredibly loud out-of-control frat party in 1985 when a friend and I were remote camping in a heavily wooded unihabited area around Patrick Creek in Del Norte Co. just north of Humboldt.  There were voices in deep male tonations as well as slightly higher and higher still [juvenile?]  I've heard coyotes, bears wolves etc etc. I've also spent time with my sister who was doing her graduate project in anthropolgy on primates at the San Diego zoo.  The closest I can compare the sounds to were Howler monkeys, but controlled.  The voices almost sounded like a dialect but none I've ever heard; like I could almost make out words.  The sounds were definitely primate in nature though definitely not human. At the time, my wolf-hybrid dog who traveled 300+ miles of the Pacific Crest Trail alone with me and who at the time was a veteran of wilderness encounters and very bold [never would hesitate to tree the largest bear] was trying to bite a hole in the tent to get in.  Once I let the trembling dog in the tent she actually tried to climb inside of my sleeping bag.  She refused to go back outside and remained whimpering in the tent with me until dawn.  At one point in the night, I awoke to hear a very heavy body tramping just outside the tent.  I heard breathing, very deep like in a broad-chested animal.  I dared not go outside until light.  Upon first light I went outside and saw what looked like a stampede had been through our campsite.  The duff was heavily scuffed with signs of foot traffic, which hadn't been there the night before. I've read a few Bigfoot stories and I've noticed that sometimes the sound of children playing has attracted sighting situations.  I once had a problem with a mentally ill person who was sneaking in my horse barn at night and letting the horses out.  After months of frustration and being told I was paranoid, I got a remote camera that had some infrared capabilities.  As expected, I caught the man and turned in a point-blank video to authorities of him.  If your researchers want a good chance at getting Bigfoot on film, why not set up a week-long or so remote campsite with tents etc. and install a infrared video camera to view the camp.  Have recordings or better yet, actual children squealing in play through the hours of the night.  Review the tapes each day and see what you get.  It worked for me.

We didn't want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two malamute cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many backcountry adventures. As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep. Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from \\\"childlike\\\" to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat. party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I've had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation. We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning. The second \\\"experience\\\" I had at Avenue of the Giants was with the samefriend while we were hiking a trail there. It was again the fall of 1985 about a month later than the first. We had a map with us and decided to cut a loop short by going crosscountry through the dense redwood forest. Not long after we got started, the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline. We reached the top and noticed large foot shaped impressions (maybe 14-18 inches long and 8-10 inches wide) in the duff below.

      "{\"REPORT_NUMBER\": \"2954\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class A\", \"COUNTY\": \"Del Norte County\", \"MONTH\": \"August\", \"YEAR\": \"1993\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"About twenty-five miles outside of Bluff Creek\", \"OBSERVED\": \"As a young person I vaguely remember hearing something about a creature called \\\"Bigfoot\\\". I suppose I thought he was something the Indians had conjured up. That is how others seemed to think. Then approximately eight years ago, my sister gave me a book to read during a visit in Florida. I think it was called \\\"Mysteries of The Unexplained.\\\" I found it to be an interesting book, especially the story about a creature called \\\"Bigfoot.\\\" I don't remember the details, however, I do remember thinking that there is much more to this so-called myth than meets the eye. Sometime later I saw the famous \\\"Patterson Film\\\". A film of a large, heavy, hairy, bipedal subject quickly walking away from a startled cameraman and his horse. My curiosity at that point had me wanting to find out for myself what the truth was. Was this creature real or just a never-ending series of hoaxes and grossly exaggerated stories? I was in no position at the time to set out on an expedition so I promised myself and a few close friends that someday I would head to the northwest corner of the United States, the reported home of this creature, and answer the question for myself. Years later the opportunity finally presented itself. I started purchasing enough supplies for a thirty day solo expedition into the northwest. Having recently read three books on the subject of Bigfoot, I thought my best bets were either Washington State, Oregon, Northern California or Idaho. Sightings were consistent in and around the large forests of these states. While purchasing supplies, I picked up the August issue of a camping magazine that, as it turned out, contained an article about backpacking in Northern California. The article stated that you are more likely to see a bigfoot in the forests of this region, than another human being. I took the article seriously. Northern California here I come. At this point I had read enough material to have a plan that I was confident would bring me face to face with one of these creatures. My plan was not to go after one. It was to give one the opportunity to come to me. I just had to put myself in itsbackyard. As I made my way into the northwest corner of the state, I realized I wasn't in for a casual stroll through a forest. This forest was thick with undergrowth and either going almost straight up or straight down. One week into my \\\"hike\\\" into the back-country I decided to change my plan. After reflecting on conversations I'd had with the locals, I decided to turn around and head for an area about twenty-five miles from where I was now standing. The people that had talked openly with me about bigfoot activity, all mentioned geographical locations that were in the same general vicinity. They also said that there hadn't been any activity there in the past ten or so years. After making my way to this new location, I met a man that had lived there for the past thirty years. He said pretty much the same thing everyone else said. I had come to the right place but I was about ten years too late. He then pointed to a spot on my map that to the best of his recollection was the area many footprints and sightings had been reported over a decade ago. That would be my final destination. At this point my feeling that a bigfoot was no longer in this immediate area was growing somewhat stronger. I considered the possibility that bigfoots had lived here at one time and now lived elsewhere due to the logging activity in this valley some ten to thirty years ago. The forests of this area are large enough to play hide and seek with the entire U.S. Army. Dense forest covers the land further than the eyes can see and these creatures could be anywhere in it. I pressed on. As I made my way toward my final destination I continued to look for signs of something big and heavy leaving some kind of marks on the earth. If they were still around I should find something. I came across what looked like a bedding area for a creature that could fit a bigfoot's description. It was a bowl like depression in the ground about eight feet in diameter. Everything within this circle was flattened. It was only fifteen feet from a stream. Convenient I thought. There was also what looked like a large print on the side of this bowl headed toward the water. Many small to medium sized trees in the immediate vicinity were bent over or broken off at the base. It all fit, but it could be a bear's resting place, I thought. I left without bothering to take a picture. That same day I followed an old logging road to a point that it turned into a poor excuse for a rabbit trail. Along the way I found three depressions, about 14 inches long and 7 inches wide, in the soft mossy like growth between two old fallen trees. It appeared to be three steps taken by a very large and heavy bipedal animal. Coincidence, I thought, and pushed on. By this time on my trip I had seen several bear, a couple of deer and two mountain. Their tracks were all over the place -- especially bear tracks. Bear excrement was also in great abundance. This put me at ease. The better they were eating the less they would be interested in what I was eating. Blackberries are abundant in August, and from the looks of the scat it appeared the bears were taking full advantage of this. Visibility was usually about ten to fifty yards through the trees. Some of the noises that had been around me on a regular basis were bear and deer that I could not see because of the poor visibility. At the start of this expedition I would reach for the pepper spray at the mere sound of a couple of squirrels playing in the leaves. This behavior was probably due to the fact that a bear had wanted to join me for dinner the very first evening I was in the bush. I'll never forget the sound of him coming towards me through the forest. From that point forward I was well aware that I was carrying approximately forty pounds of bear bait (thirty day food supply) on my back. As my time in the woods progressed so did my ability to guess what animals were around me by the sounds they made in the brush. Given the opportunity, my eyes would usually confirm what my ears had told me. Since I was on foot and usually on a logging road, I sometimes got extremely close to animals before they realized I was there. One time I had walked to within 35 feet of two bear (not on purpose) that were feeding off to the side of the logging road. They never heard, saw or smelled me. Anyway, I reached my destination and made camp at the intersection of four logging roads. It was now almost two weeks into the expedition. My plan was to recon the three logging roads that led down to a river. If I could get to the river I might find some nice fresh bigfoot tracks in the sandy banks along the waters edge. I checked out the east road that evening. No luck. It dead ended about a quarter mile from the river just like the forestry map showed. I went back to camp, ate dinner, set out a chem-light and hit the tent. I put the chem-light out in hopes of deterring bear from casually strolling into my little area of operation. The night passed without incident. I slept like a log. How appropriate. The next morning I checked out the north road. Success, it led right down to a nice open field next to the river. The map I was given by the National Forest Service showed it to dead-end about half a mile short. I'm glad I checked it out. I thoroughly checked the southern bank of the river. No tracks. The northern bank was covered with heavy growth, therefore I did not plan on a crossing to check it out. No tracks and I was sure this was the place that had stirred up much of the controversy some ten to thirty years ago. As I stood in the field and looked back towards the forest, I decided to check all around the field. I started at the west end. Almost immediately after starting this new search pattern I came across a depression similar to the ones I had recently seen but didn't pay too much attention to. Again there was no detail because of the type of ground. It was a bigger and deeper depression than I thought a man or bear could ever make. I looked further and there was another one and then another one. This time I was sure these were tracks because there were about seven of them strung together in the pattern of a natural bipedal walk. I walked in the tracks. The bottom of the depressions were very hard. As though something of great weight had made them the last time this ground was wet. The distance between the steps was not extraordinary, at an average of about three feet apart. I lost the track momentarily over hard ground and then found it again. It was a consistent track. I figured I was tracking him (I say him when in all actuality it may be a her) the opposite direction he was walking judging from the shape of the tracks. It was now time for something to happen that I had never considered or read about in any book. I followed the tracks through a soft section of ground to the base of a fifty foot tall pine tree. At the base of the pine tree was an area of ground that looked as though it had been trampled down repeatedly by this heavy creature. It was at that very instant that I realized he had been leaning against the tree. Then it occured to me that if he was leaning against this bark and sap covered tree, there must be hair stuck to it. I moved may face closer and there it was. From a level of about three to six feet off the ground, hair was stuck in crevices and tree sap. I collected some samples and then stood, in the same place that this creature had stood, with my back against the tree. I couldn't help but notice the nice view of the open field next to the river he might have enjoyed while standing in that position. The surface of my back from my buttocks to the area between my shoulder blades naturally was against the tree. If this creature did not put his head against the tree, as I did not do, then I guessed that I was about 2 feet shorter than the Bigfoot that had rested against this tree. I'm 5'10\\\". After collecting the hair samples from the tree I continued tracking. I had only gone another twenty yards when I found a similar trampled down area at the base of another pine. This pine however was a much younger tree and the top had been broken off at a height of about 6 feet. The top was lying off to the side. As I looked closer I noticed that all of the branches on the side of the tree directly over the trampled down area were either bent back and to the side or broken off. Hair was all over this tree as well. This creature wasn't resting against trees, he was scratching his back! I continued the track and had only gone another 15 or so feet when I found another young pine that was in the same condition as the one I had just inspected. The top had been broken off at about the 6 foot level also. More broken and bent branches with the telltale hair stuck in the bark and sap. This creature had a definite itch. Since I was tracking him backwards, I guessed that he must have tried to rid himself of this itch on the two small trees. They probably weren't sturdy enough to satisfy him so he made his way over to the large pine and finished the job. The tops of the small pines that I found lying on the ground still had a small percentage of green needles with the majority looking brown and dying. I don't know enough about trees to make an educated guess as to how long ago the tops had been broken off. I ventured to guess that it was no longer than a month before I stood in the very same spot. Wow, he had been through here quite recently I thought to myself. For some reason I thought he had just been passing through and was no longer in this area. He had been here but was long gone into another valley. Looking back I am not quite sure why I didn't think he was still around. Maybe it was because I wasn't finding any fresh tracks. I continued tracking him for another three hundred yards or so. He was about as hard to track as an elephant through a corn field. The tracks led to the edge of the thick forest undergrowth at which point I decided to terminate my efforts. Looking back over the area I had tracked, I realized he had stayed just inside the edge of the wood-line the whole way. A smart bigfoot, I thought, unlike the bear and deer that were leaving their tracks all over the place in the wide open field. As I started to circle back around the east end of this large open field next to the river, I came upon a large pile of excrement. It looked human except for the fact it was a very large pile and the contents were plant-like. As I mentioned earlier, I had seen a lot of bear dung and this looked quite different. Tracks led up to and then appeared to straddle this dropping. Again, this was not the best ground for holding a track, however it did look as though the tracks were made by a large, heavy, bipedal ... bigfoot. I collected a large sample of the excrement and put it into a plastic baggy. At this point I was feeling pretty good about what I had found and satisfied that this had been a successful expedition even if I wasn't going to see a bigfoot. I had hair and excrement samples -- good physical evidence that a bigfoot is still roaming these woods. I looked around some more and found two more of the same type of piles fairly close to the first one. I remember thinking this must have been his bathroom. He probably would feed all night, get a drink from the river and then relieve himself here. If this was being done by a bigfoot then he seemed to be a creature of habit. By this time I had been down by the river for a good few hours. I headed back to camp which was located about two miles up the logging road. After dinner I decided to go ahead and recon the west road which was the last logging road I had to check out. It came to a dead end just as the east road had. As I was making my way back to camp, before the mosquitos set in, I noticed something I did not see on my way out. On the north side of this old logging road stood a young pine tree that had been topped at a point about 6 feet above the ground. I immediately looked down at the base of this tree and saw what I knew I would see. The large trampled down area of ground. Those big padded feet had stood right there. I then saw the tracks leading up to the tree as well as the top of the tree lying on the ground off to the side. This time I closely inspected the broken off top of the tree and found hair stuck on it. Hair most likely from the side of the hand that broke it off. I must add at this point that I was keeping a lookout for claw marks in the tracks and teeth marks on the broken off tree tops which would most likely have been left behind if a bear had done this. I was paying attention to this not for myself but for the people that would ask me later about it, when this expedition was done. I had no doubt what was doing this and it wasn't a bear. Anyway, I didn't find a trace of either claw or teeth marks. This time I kept the broken part of this little pine with hair intact in the sap and put it in a plastic baggy. It seemed as though this creature had a habit of preparing these small pines for back scratching posts in an intelligent and consistent manner. I wondered if other bigfoots did this. I completed my journey back to the tent and realized that the pine I had just collected the sample from was only about 100 yards away. If the other depressions I had seen on the way into this area were indeed tracks as I thought they could be, then bigfoot was leaving too much evidence around here to be just passing through. I figured I was camped right smack in the middle of a bigfoot's backyard. I had gathered about three chords of firewood in the course of the day which I now started using to stoke up a pretty good sized camp fire. The wood burned quickly because of the fact it was very old and dry. About every twenty minutes or so, I would have to put on another log. This kept the fire at just under the bonfire setting. Darkness fell without incident. No bears, no mountain lion and no bigfoots. Wow, if my friends could see me now. Bigfoot Bait! Every few minutes or so I would look up the west logging road and then up the east logging road. The north and south avenues of approach were covered by very heavy brush. I could here a lizard coming toward me from either of those directions so I wasn't too concerned about them. Actually it would have to be a pretty large lizard to be heard over the snap, crackle and pop of my camp fire. I passed some time by sharpening the ends of my walking stick. I got a chuckle out of the fact that my walking stick was about three feet longer than the one I had started with. The further away from civilization I got the softer I walked and the bigger the stick I carried. Everything I had read about and heard about bigfoots told me that they are not aggressive unless shot at. Since I had no gun that wasn't a problem, however I did keep the pepper spray ready at all times just in case. I also tried to stay aware of which direction the breeze was blowing because into it the pepper spray had a maximum effective range of only about two feet. I continued to look up and down the two logging roads. My camp site was surrounded by complete darkness. I looked at my watch. It was 11:00pm. If I didn't see anything by 1:00am I would hit the tent for a good night sleep. A bigfoot could be miles from here. Time dragged on as I occasionally looked up and down the two roads. I was sitting on a short log set in an upright position at a distance of about five feet from the fire. My back was to the fire so that it wouldn't impede my vision as I scanned the surrounding darkness. I looked into the darkness of the west road then looked into the darkness of the east road. That is when it happened. The hair on my back and neck stood straight up. It was the strongest instinctive reaction I had ever had in my life. I was looking directly into a pair of eyes that were looking directly at me. I didn't move a muscle. It was a bigfoot. There was no doubt in my mind that what I was looking at was not a bear, mountain lion, owl or a deer. His eyes were set wide apart and well above where I knew the ground should be. I didn't take my eyes off of them. The Omah, as it is called by the local Indians, was watching me. Something that I had not spent much time thinking about, until right at that moment, was now of prime concern to me. Had anyone ever taken a shot at this creature? Did this creature, for whatever reason, hold any sort of grudge against human beings? I hoped not. Actually it was more like a quick prayer. I did not want him to direct any ill will towards me at all. It most likely would have been about 750 pounds of powerful ill will. He wasn't moving. I wasn't moving either, even though my neck was crooked to the left in an uncomfortable position. I watched him and he watched me. The longer I looked into his eyes, the more I got the feeling this was just an intelligent and lonely creature curious to see what I was doing. I began to relax. I had a Mini-Mag flashlight in my left hand and the pepper spray in my right. I wondered if I should shine the flashlight on him to get a look at his body. Again I should point out that this could have been a female, but for the sake of simplicity I will continue to refer to the creature as \\\"he\\\". I opted not to shine the flashlight on him. He came to me, I saw him, and now the ball was back in his court. I waited for him to make the next move. His nocturnal eyes were reflecting the light of the fire I was sitting next to. I tried to make out the outline of his body. I could not. The camp fire illuminated bushes and trees out to a certain distance depending on how recently I had put on a fresh log. Beyond that point of illumination the forest was pitch black. I believe the fire was at a point that a fresh log had just been added when I first looked up and saw Bigfoot. I continued to observe. The right eye (his left), occasionally seemed to fade in and out as though it was partially blocked by a leaf or branch of the bush I was sure he was standing behind. Earlier, at times when I really had the fire going, the front of this bush would be illuminated for the period of time that the fire was brightest. I couldn't see the bush now but I was sure of it's position. As I studied his eyes I got the impression they were wet. Liquidy you might say. An effect probably caused by the flickering of the fire they were reflecting. They were a glossy yellow when I first saw them and faded to a real faint yellow (almost white) toward the end of our staring session. Looking back, I would guess that while paying complete attention to him I had neglected the fire and as the fire lessoned in intensity so did his eyes. Occasionally it looked as though he would blink. His eyes would simultaneously disappear for a fraction of a second. It also looked as though his head was shifting from side to side. Similar, I thought, to what I would do if I was trying to observe someone from behind a bush. His eyes looked to be approximately 4 1/2 to 5 inches apart and almost 1 inch in diameter. Minutes ticked by. My neck was beginning to get sore from the position I was sitting and watching him as he watched me. I casually looked at my watch. It was 12:15am. Then I slowly raised and extended my left arm for the purpose of using my hand as a measuring tool. He didn't move while I did this. He just kept watching. I used the width of my left hand to measure the distance from his eyes to the top of a lone pine silhouette against the night sky in the background. I made a mental note that his eyes were almost directly under and 2 hand widths below the tip of the lone pine. I also made a mental note not to move the log I was sitting on for the rest of the night. I would use this information when the sun came up. After making these observations, I decided to relieve the soreness in my neck and look at him from another position. I slowly spun around in the direction away from him. I didn't want him to think I was getting ready to confront him. I looked up and he was still there watching me. I remember wondering if he could tell if I was watching him. The fire was now slightly behind and to the left of me. From his vantage point, I was most likely silhouette by the fire. His eyes were now getting harder to see. They were there but not as bright. My eyes were getting sore from staring. Then I noticed how dark it was getting in my camp. The fire had barely a flame left to flicker. It didn't take me long to decide that I wasn't going to sit here in complete darkness with a bigfoot just spittin distance away. I slowly stood up to get another log from the pile that was just out of reach. I positioned the log in the fire and sat back down. When I looked up I could not find his eyes. He was gone. At about 3:15am I thought I could see his eyes again but in a position further back from where he had stood the first time. I was kind of expecting him to come back and see what I was up to. It was hard to tell if he did or not, but I think he did. Time passed slowly as I waited for the sun to come up so I could check for tracks. I'd thought about doing it with a flashlight but rejected the idea. I would see things much more clearly in the morning. As the sun came up I sat in the same position I was in when I had measured his eyes from the top of that lone pine tree. According to how everything lined up his eyes would have been centered at the top of the 8 foot bush that stood 70 feet from where I had been sitting. When it was light enough to see the ground fairly well, I made my way over to the area behind the bush. It was an area that was just to the side of the logging road. The ground was similar to the logging road itself which was hard packed gravel. The difference was that the area where I figured a bigfoot should have been standing was covered in a dry, sparse, wheat type of grass. There they were -- the same size tracks I had been finding all along. The tracks were not much more than the grass being squashed, and I do mean flattened, in the shape of a big padded foot. Narrower at one end than the other and approximately 16 inches long and 7 to 8 inches wide at the front of the track. There was a set of tracks leading to a point exactly behind the bush where they then became less distinguishable as though he had been shuffling around. There was however one depression in the ground at a point close to the bush. I guessed it would have been his right foot that made it by its shape. I stood where it looked as though he had stood and found myself directly behind the bush. I looked up to see that if I was about 2 feet taller my eyes would have been at bush-top level. There was another set of tracks that led away at a slightly different angle than the set that led in. He had come in and left on the east logging road. Nice and quiet. No crashing through the forest. At this point I thought to look for a hair sample around the tracks in hopes of later matching it with the samples I already had. I got down on my stomach and looked. Nothing. I quickly looked over the logging road for more tracks but didn't find anything. It was very hard packed. Decision time. Do I stay camped here and hope to see a bigfoot in the daytime? This is when I realized I had taken too many pictures the day before and I didn't have anymore film for the camera. Last time that ever happens. Anyway, Bigfoot is nocturnal and daytime sightings are extremely rare. He would probably be somewhere very well hidden and fast asleep during daytime hours. As I mentioned earlier my plan was to stay thirty days in the bush. But now that I had the hair, excrement and tree samples as well as the pictures of the tracks and the experience of last night. I decided 2 weeks was long enough. I packed everything up and headed out on the east logging road. I was walking at a pretty good pace. Having 17 miles to cover before nightfall with about 60 pounds worth of gear still in my rucksack, I didn't want to waste any time. I'd only gotten about 75 yards up the logging road when I heard what sounded like an extremely large animal thrashing in the woods at a point next to where I was walking. The noise was so close that I didn't think I was going to get the pepper spray I wore on my left forearm out of its holder in time to use it. Then I realized it was running away from me. Crashing through the woods I think best describes it. Large branches snapping as it escaped my nearness. As I listened to it's escape I tried to figure out what it was. It covered a lot of ground very, very quickly. Through the process of elimination I started guessing. The list of possibilities was short because there are not many animals large enough to have possibly made that much noise. The speed suggested a deer but there was no snorting or hoof sounds that I had previously heard from deer running away from me. Nor did the animal in question sound as \\\"fleet-footed\\\" as a deer. The feet were crunching a lot of material underneath them suggesting that they were large surfaced extremities. Could it have been a bear? Possibly, but all the bear I had dealt with to this point were not that afraid of anything. The creature in question was also running away from me on the downhill side of the road and it is my understanding that bear don't run downhill too well. Things happened very quickly, which made it hard to tell, but it also sounded as though the creature I had heard was not getting away from me in a four legged gallop. There is one thing I am sure of. The noise I had heard was caused by an extremely large and powerful creature that desperately did not want to be that close to me. I will venture to guess that my ole buddy had stayed pretty close to me the whole night and may have even been watching for me the next morning. I call him that because I felt as though we had somehow bonded during my long look into his eyes that night by the camp fire. I had seen his soul and it was a kind soul. My question had been answered.

I didn't report this because I thought the park service would think we were nuts, and I new of no other source that would take it seriously. I also didn't think the location of my sighting was one where other sightings had accrued until I used your sightings map. It was April 1993 when I went hiking in Desolation Wilderness with two of my friends for a bachelor weekend. We started out at the Horse Shoe Falls trailhead at Twin Bridges off of HW50 and hiked up to Lake Aloha. It was very hot going up the falls so we were very surprised to se all the snow at the top (that year we had some late snowstorms). We were disappointed because the lake still had a lot of ice on it, but not enough to walk on. We tried to walk around the lake but the deep snow and steep sides male it unappeasable. We set up camp at the south end of the lake 200 yards west of the trail near a picnic bench. We were the only ones up there that fare in except some one that went up the southern slope of eastern mountain. There was no other tracks going around the lake and to my knowledge the back way in was to far to hike in those conditions. Trevor and I woke up early  (near sun up) to try to fish in one of the unfrozen spots near the bank, but it had frozen over that night. We were looking over the lake when we noticed some one on the other side of the lake walking around. We watched him because we didn't think there was a way around the lake and were curious how he got there. That's when it walked by the picnic table across the lake and we noticed that it was a lot larger than we were judging were the table came to on it's leg compared to were our picnic table came to on us (I'm 6ft and Trevor is 6.1ft). That's when we got out the binoculars and took a better look. We couldn't ses any detail of its face but its whole body looked dark brown to black. We were arguing about what we were looking at because we didn't want to believe what were looking at. At first we thought it was a bear but it walk to well on its back feet. We thought it was a hiker but it was not quite walking like a man (judging the long strides by the bench, we could not walk like that comfortley) and how easily it moved across the snow. We went over to the tent to wake up Rob and show him but by the time we got back, he was gone. About 15min. later a lone hiker came down the southern slope of the eastern mountain into our camp and we asked him if he saw any thing on the other side of the lake and he said he watched some thing walking near the lake and then leave out through the north west side. We asked him if he saw any way we could get to that side and he said he could not see a way over. We told him about what we saw and he noticed the same thing (but not the same detail) we did. The sighting was about 10 minutes or so, and has left us a lot to think about. I don't know if it was a Big Foot or not, but after watching the famous video of the Big Foot walking, I noticed that that's the strange way we saw the \\\"thing\\\" moving. \", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Twin Bridges\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Highway 50\", \"COUNTY\": \"El Dorado County\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"6am aprox.

It resembles a human foot almost with the exception of the size, claws and the contours to it are quite different than a human print. I found the print near a small stream about 10 miles north and east of Placerville, CA. There were several prints in the area and tree branches that were broken along the stream. Only one print was worth looking at so I took some pictures of it. The next day I went back to the area and took a plaster cast of it as well.. I took the print to the Fish and Game to see if it was perhaps just a bear print or something. They thought it was a joke. I put the print in my closet and it has been there ever since.

We had just come back from fishing and were sitting in camp talking before we went to bed. No campfires are allowed in Desolation Wilderness so we were just kicking back in camp.

This is a large glacier carved granite canyon. After fishing for a while we decide to hike out of the canyon and up to the Pacific Crest Trail to see if we could see Lake Tahoe. Its about a two mile hike and I am sure not many people have ever done this before. This area is a very remote part of the wilderness and we have never seen anyone else in there. As we hiked out of the canyon we started to see very large dry turds (Scat). Both my son and I have seen large piles of bear crap before but these were long and bigger in diameter than a pork and bean can.  We both commented that these were the biggest turds we had ever seen and were joking that if it was a bear it must be a giant one. I broke up several of the turds but there was really no evidence of berries, fir or bone that you usually see in scat. They were just big solid dry turds. Again we didn't have big foot on our minds so we just thought that it was a giant bear turd. Now I believe that they might have been from a Bigfoot. My son and I have considered purchasing one of those remote motion type wildlife cameras and going back in there and seeing what we could capture on film. We are planning another trip into desolation at the end of June and would be glad to take a BFRO investigator with us. We are now both convienced that Bigfoot exists and plan to explore some very remote areas of Placer and ElDorado counties to see what we can see and or find.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"A couple of years later we got on the BFRO web site and read about several other Bigfoot type incidents in Placer and Eldorado counties. A couple of them were actually not far from where we live in Foresthill or other areas that we have been to in the Tahoe and Eldorado Nat. Forests.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"During the second week of July 2000 my son (16 years old then) and I had backpacked into the northern part of Desolation Wilderness from the Loon Lake Trail head in Eldorado County, California. Desolation is located in the El Dorado National Forest.  To get to the trailhead you take Hwy 50 east out of Placerville and turn off on the Crystal Basin Lakes Road. Follow this road about 20 miles to Loon Lake and the Desolation Wilderness Trail head parking lot. From the trailhead we hiked into Rockbound Lake and camped near the outlet of the lake which goes down to Buck Island Lake. We stayed there for four days. This is a place that we backpack into quite often and are very familiar with the area. We usually set up a base camp at Rockbound and then day hike and fish at several lakes in the area as well as the Rubicon River.  Desolation Wilderness is just west of Lake Tahoe and the Pacific Crest Trail. On our third night there we sitting in camp.  We had fished until dark and it must have been about 9:30 or 10:30PM. It stays lite very late in the summer and we usually fish until dark. At that time we heard a very loud scream that came from the northeast shore of the lake. A few seconds later we heard two more loud screams that came from the same direction. These screams were very loud and not like anything that we had ever heard before. My son and I have both heard mountain lions scream before but these were much louder and very high pitched. We knew that the screams were to loud to be a bird and really didn't know what they were. At that time we didn't even think that it may be a bigfoot. We had both heard about Bigfoot but it wasn't something that came to mind when we heard the screams. Shortly after the screams we went to bed and didn't hear anything else. The next morning I got up just before daylight so we could pack up and hike back to Loon Lake before it got to hot. My son was awake but still in our tent.  At this time we both heard the biggest loudest roar that was nothing like we had ever heard before. This roar came from the south end of the lake. My son quickly got out of the tent and we just started to ask each other what it was when there was another loud roar from across the lake. About ten seconds later there was another loud roar from way up in the Rubicon River canyon which was about 2 miles away. This roar was muffled because of the distance but was still loud enough to hear. About five seconds later there was another loud roar that came from where we had heard the screams the night before. Five seconds later there was a very, very, loud roar that came from about 50 yards or less behind our camp.  At that time my son and I turned and ran over a small hill behind our camp to see if we could see anything. The area behind camp was fairly open with alot of granite and brush and a few trees. At that time we really didn't know what we were looking for but we thought that we might be able to see something. We hiked around the area and over to a snow pond but didn't see or hear anything else. At that time we returned to camp, packed up our stuff and started to hike  back to Loon Lake.  On the hike back we talked quite a bit about what we had heard and were joking that it was probably several bigfoots communicating with each other. I guess we really didn't want to believe that we had heard a bigfoot but we both knew that there is no other animals in the woods that can make the type of screams and roars that we had heard. A few days later I drove back to the El Dorado National Forest Ranger station at Camino, Calif. and asked a couple of employees at the counter if they had ever had anyone report hearing any loud roars or screams in the Desolation Wilderness area. One of the employees told me that someone else had reported hearing some loud screams a few weeks earlier. I then told the employees what my son and I had heard and one of them said it sounds like a bigfoot to me.  They also told me that there was someone at that office who takes reports on possible bigfoot happenings and I left my name and number but never heard from anyone. Over the next couple of years my son and I had told several people about what we had heard but really didn't find anyone else who had heard the same thing.  Most people we talked to had no reason not to believe us but really had no idea how loud the screams and roars were. By this time we both began to believe that we had heard several bigfoots communicating with each other but really had no way to prove it. A friend of mine then told me about the BFRO Wedsite and we logged on and found out that there were other hikers that had reported actually seeing a couple of Bigfoots in the Desolation Wilderness not very far from where we had camped. We talked about submitting a report but never got around to it. A couple of months ago the same friend gave me a video tape of the Discovery Channel show about Bigfoot. When I heard the recordings of Bigfoot screams I knew then that we had heard the exact same thing. The only difference was that the screams we heard were louder.  Probably because we were actually hearing them naturally and not on a tape. About a month later my son was able to view the Bigfoot video and when he heard the screams he said, Dad thats exactly what we heard.  We listened to them several more times  and agreed that we would submit a report. There has never been any doubt in our minds that the screams and roars we heard could not have come from any known animal species that lives in the Sierras. We both wanted to believe we had heard a Bigfoot but really had nothing to compare it to until we heard the screams on the Discovery Channel video tape. My son was raised in the Sierras and I have lived there for 20 years so both of us are quite familiar with the local animals and sounds. I am also a wildlife biologist and know that the sounds we heard could not have come from a bear or mountain lion.

When it saw our vehicle approaching it began to run from the center of the road to the other side into the trees as we passed. The general motion was from right to left heading west to east toward the lake form the campgroud area.  The strange thing was that it was clearly not a bear or any kind of four legged animal. It had a distinkt two legged run as I would expect a human to have, but was covered with hair (or fur) that was much longer than that of other furry animals and had a rust colored hugh to it. It ran slightly bent over and had medium hight (5-6'). It happened too fast to make out special features like feet, hands or the shape of the head. I could only see the running form of the body. The first thing that I thought was that it looked like a big foot, but was hesitant to suggest that to my wife. She in her exitement pointed to it and began to say \\\"look at the bear\\\" but stopped up short. I told her that I didn't look like that to me.  She was the one who suggested that it  really looked more like a Sasquatch, and at that point I know that we had both seen the same thing. A few reflections: 1. I would prefer to believe that it was just a prank by some fun seeking camper, but it was very real. This animal did not run or move as I would expect a human to run or move. What we saw was not a prank. 2. I can't think of a reason why anyone would go to that much work to fool a motorist for no apparent reason. 3.

I immediately stopped moving to try and see if I could hear any movement.  Then, from the west across the cove, the same sound responded.  The scream from the west continued at least 15 to 20 times.  There were other campsites and I remember seeing someones shadow as they walked to the bathroom.  The screams got louder and the individual hurried to the bathroom letting the door slam behind him.  The screams stopped and did not return.  My wife and two kids slept through the whole thing which surprised me considering how loud the scream was.  The next morning I asked my father-in-law and my wife's uncle, who were in the other sites, if they heard the screams. Both them and their wives heard them as well.  My father in-law, and my wife's uncle thought it might have been a group of coyotes, but we all agreed that we never heard anything like that before in our lives.

I've heard calls and screams matching sould bites and reports on your site in the same areas I've heard the sounds in the Desolation Wilderness area. I've read reports on your site that seem to indicate there may be a concentration of these animals in the Desolation Winderness North of Highway 50 between Pollock Pines and Echo Summit. I also read a report on your site that finally convinced me to subit my report. It was a report that mirrors the behavior I witnessed, \\\"the animal going down on all fours to escape an oncoming vehicle\\\"\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"I am posting this report after several months of trying to dismiss what I saw as a bear or other common animal. I have come to the conclusion that what I saw could only have been an unknown animal such as Sasquatch, as the behavior and curiosity of the animal does not match any animal I am aware of, yet is consistant with Sasquatch descriptions I have read on this and other web sites. I had heard recent reports of black bear sightings becoming more common in the Pollock Pines area and that the bears are extending their range from the Rubicon/Desolation Wilderness area south to Pollock Pines. Two black bears had recently been hit and killed on Highway 50 about 3 miles north of my encounter. All this talk of bears in our area is what led me to initially conclude that what I had seen was a bear. Approximately 5:30am sometime in early fall I was travelling northbound about 45mph on Sly Park road heading toward Highway 50. It was almost completely dark, there was some light starting to become visible, there where no other vehicles. I rounded a sharp corner to the left going downhill when my highbeams hit a large animal on the left side of the road, it was standing on two legs and was facing to the left. It appeared to be grabing at something in the trees in the front yard of a residence. As soon as my light hit the animal it quickly turned 180 degrees to it's right in a twisting motion going down on all fours and proceding to run on all fours to the other side of the road. The right side of the road had thick brush which at that time appeared to be about 3 feet tall. The right side of the road also opens into thick forest land. Upon first seeing the animal I slowed down to about 25mph to be sure this large \\\"bear\\\" got across the road without me hitting it. As I drove past the location where the animal had entered the brush I looked out the passenger window and to my surprise I saw it's face in the brush looking right into the window only a few feet away. I saw large reddish brown eyes, a large brown head and a dull black (not shiny) area that would have been the nose. I did not see ears and since it was looking straight on, I was unable to discern a flat or pronounced snout. In retrospect the face appeared to convey an emotional look of concern or panic. During the encounter I did not consider the animal to be anything other than a bear until several minutes later when I thought it was odd that the animal would cross the road to escape then stop just inside the brush to watch me pass. I would think a Bear would continue to run into the forest. Even with this curious behavior I continued to assume it had been a bear. I was shocked into reconsidering my expanation a few weeks later when road crews cleared the brush away revealing that the brush was growing on a drop off that was 5 feet lower than the road, making the brush 8 feet tall. This would rule out the animal being on all fours while looking into my passenger window. The animal had to have stood up again immidiately after entering the brush to reach the hight required to look into my window, that would place the animal at approximately 8 feet tall. Is it likely that all the behavior I have described can be attributed to a bear, not likely in my opinion.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Pollock Pines\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Sly Park road about 3 miles from Highway 50\", \"COUNTY\": \"El Dorado County\", \"DATE\": \"1\", \"YEAR\": \"2003\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"Approx: 5:30am.

When I jumped out and yelled at \\\"it\\\" and then fired my .45 into a dead tree a few feet away, it ran away into the brush, but only about 50 feet back into the woods. This I thought was unusual, because a bear will usually take off running and not stop until sunrise! After about 15 mintues it got really quiet and I assumed it had left the area.

But other than that, the only other time where I had an encounter was a hunting trip into the Snow Mountain wilderness area up above Elk Creek, California. That will be a whole different episode!\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"I used to live in Camino, CA and would go up into Desolation Wilderness as often as I could. The trout fishing was really incredible and it left a wonderful lasting memory with me. Since moving from the area, I hadn't been there in several years. I talked to a friend of mine about going up and camp overnight and do some stream fishing. He agreed and also invited another friend along for the ride. We got up there in the early afternoon and hiked upstream from Wright's lake and then set up camp. A couple hours later a ranger came by and informed us that we hadn't actually made it into Desolation Wilderness yet, and that we needed to keep hiking for a while. We broke camp and then the 2 guys that were with me, suggested that we go into Placerville and get a room. Apparently they weren't up to camping and fishing after all. I said no thanks and that I wanted to come up here, to come up there and fish, not go party somewhere in town. So they left and I went up the hill farther. The ranger had suggested a great camping and fishing location, but because it was starting to get later in the afternoon, there was no way I would make it all the way before dark. He gave me a general location of where it could be found and what trails to take to get there, but when most of the area is large (football field size) sheets of granite, the trails are only marked with stacks of rocks and they are few and far between. I ended up getting lost a bit, but I could hear the stream flowing over rocks to the north of me. I walked in another half mile or so and located the stream. Below me about 35 feet down a granite cliff was a stream that did have a pool in it, right on the tree line. I thought what a beautiful place that would be to have a campsite and then picked my way down the steep cliff side. I set up my camp directly next to the pool and also with the treeline and some very dense woods about 6 feet away to the north. The pool was on the east side of me. I started fishing as soon as my tent was back up and had a gorgeous finish to a very nice day. Then after it got dark, I climbed into my sleeping bag looking to the east to the Crystal range, I think it is called, and watched as the glow of a full moon worked it's way up over the top of the granite mountains. Once it was over, my day was complete and I decided to go to sleep. That was at 10:30 pm. As I started to drift off to sleep, I heard what can only be described as a very low rumbling growl. When I go into a wilderness area, especially a place I know has bears really thick, I always carry a handgun with me. On this occassion it was a .45 compact. When I heard the growl, it really scared the crap out of me, because it was so close. I jumped up, with my .45 in hand and looked out the top of the screen mesh on the tent. I could see a dark mass about 4 1/2 feet tall, right at the edge of the tree line, 6 feet from my head. I yelled some really loud obscenities and started climbing out of my tent. Once I was clear of the door I brought up my pistol and fired into a dead tree a few feet away from what I thought was a big black bear. As soon as the pistol went off, it turned and ran back into the brush, but it didn't seem to go very far and that concerned me. Bears will usually run like heck and for a long time when they get a shot that close. This seemed to go maybe 50 feet or so into very thick brush. I could hear it thrashing about as it moved deeper into the trees, but then it just stopped. It all went quiet for about 15 minutes or so and then I tried going back to bed. Shortly after I started hearing what sounded like somewhat large rocks, hitting in the water, just above the pool I was camped beside. It would happen every couple of minutes or so. It was the sound of not only the splash, but also of the rock hitting other rocks, submerged in shin deep water. That \\\"cracking\\\" sound. This really concerned me, thinking the \\\"bear\\\" may be circling my campsite and trying to get at me from a different angle. I got out out my tent on several occasions, and was trying to see if I could make out any movement on the other side of the stream but nothing. I usually keep a small flashlight in my tackle box, which I had, but it was one of those small \\\"shake it\\\" and it charges up the cell and lights up for a few minutes. Not much of a flashlight really and worse yet, the handle is clear and so when I would turn it on, the handle would light up too, actually making it harder to see. I had a full moon though and the area is surrounded with stark white granite slabs, and so except in the darkest of the woods, I could see pretty clearly. This went on like this until 2:00 am. That was when I got another \\\"visit\\\". I didn't get to see it, this time, but I heard movement really close to my tent again, same place as the first time, and when I yelled at it, I got a return of something that sounded like an \\\"Ooof\\\" \\\"Ooof\\\", but really deep sounding. I jumped out of my tent again thinking I was going to see it again, but didnt. Still, I put another shot into the dead tree and off it went crashing through the brush again. Again it only went about 50 feet back. There was something odd about the way it sounded when it was running too. I didn't catch what it was though until I listened to the footsteps of a bipedal walking from your site here. It was only on two feet!! It concerned me enough to realize that it didn't sound like a 4 legged animal at the time, but I didn't know what was different until I heard your recordings. Anyway, still thinking I was dealing with a rogue bear, I started trying to figure out what it wanted with me. Was I camped on it's trail to the water? Was it used to finding food in tents? Desolation is a very high traffic place. This particular place was a ways off the trail and it didn't appear to have much in the way of hikers. Hikers usually leave some kind of sign, trash, fish hooks, something to say that they were here before, but this place was very clean. So I decide to take my sleeping bag out of the tent and move over to the middle of this big slab of granite that I am on. There is about a 4 foot tall ledge facing the woods where all the activity was going on. But now the treeline is 50 feet away and not 6. Figuring this would give me some advance warning if I got charged. The rocks kept flying, and I kept trying to sleep with one eye open, hoping the sun would come up soon, and checking my watch all night long. Then \\\"she\\\" showed up. It was 4:40 am and something woke me. I heard movement at the tree line again and I looked to where it all started from. I didn't see anything but then I looked at my tent. Standing right next to my tent was the \\\"creature?\\\". My tent is about 4 feet tall maybe a little less and what I saw was more than twice as tall. At first I couldn't see any features, just the outline. Then it took a couple of steps towards me. I almost pee'd my pants right there. I picked up the .45 and took a shot off to the left of it. It stopped and looked at me. Then it started walking towards me again. It was very fast. I don't mean that it was running, it's just that the steps were so big, the distance was closing very fast. Had it been a bear, I would have shot it immediately, but honestly, I don't think my .45 would have been able to stop it. One shot would definitely not killed it or stopped it in its tracks. Then as it was approaching me, I took another shot, but this one much closer. I could see it very clearly at this point and yes I did pee my pants. The second shot made her stop again, and then she took off running to the northwest through an area of mostly granite slab and dotted with scrub pine. This was the last time I saw her. She ran off out of sight at great speed. I stayed up the rest of the night until it got light enough for me to hike back towards Wrights Lake to the South West. For the remainder of the darkness I pretty much stayed put with the ledge to my back and my gun in my hand, and shaking in my skin. I have not been able to sleep right since then, and for the next couple of months after the incident, I couldn't sleep at all. Everytime I closed my eyes, I would hear the growls and the rocks splashing and then see her coming at me. I would be willing to take someone back up there to show where it happened, but only during daylight hours. I have been a hunter and fisherman most of my life and have seen what I thought, was every animal in the woods at one time or another. Nothing like this has ever shown it's face before, and I hope it never does again. There was another incident however. On December 13th, 1992 up in Snow Mountain Wilderness area, above Elk Creek California.

I have photos of that I want to send. I enjoy hiking and camping on a regular basis year round. I have been considering submitting a report for my encounter over the last few months and finally I am doing it. My encounter happened about 4 months ago in July. My girlfriend and I were \\\"dispersed camping\\\" (which is where campers can legally set up a tent in the national forest for free for up to 14 days) in El Dorado National Forest off of Hwy 50, about 6 miles east of Bridal Veil Falls. We have a secluded spot we always return to on the bank of a 10-15 foot wide, 4-5 feet deep (at the deepest) river. Some time in the night, probably 1-4 AM, my girlfriend woke me up saying she heard someone jumping into the river about 50 feet away, and it sounded like the person's legs were sloshing against the water the way it would sound if you were walking fast through thigh-deep water. Sure enough, a few seconds after she whispered this to me, I heard the noise too. She was accurate in her description of the sound. I guess my protective instincts kicked in because without hesitation I unzipped the tent with my large mag-light in hand, (the type police officers use) and stood outside my tent, spotlighting the river bank and the forest around us. I saw nothing, so I called out that there were people and please go the other way, still heard nothing. After that we didn't hear any more unusual sounds. What struck me as odd was, why would anyone be walking in FREEZING cold (likely glacier run-off) water in the dark morning hours, not anywhere near any trails, and not anywhere near any roads...? (We had to hike to this spot and it's a mile from our car, down a very steep heavily forested hillside full of underbrush, which is why this spot was so hard to find and it was an accidental find, and why it stays secluded.) It had me pondering for the last few months and even brought me to considering maybe it was a bigfoot because it sounded like two legs, not the way a bear would sound trudging through the water. Plus, there was nothing in the river I could see so whoever or whatever would've had to be farther than we thought and therefor very large to make sound seem so close... The next morning we went for a long hike as it was our last day camping. We had just gotten back to the car when I looked back at the treeline we had just came out of a, sort of, for a last glance, I will miss you, type of look, and I saw what I first thought was a black bear in the very top (the literal tip) of a 60-70 foot pine tree, it was staying still but I could see it was wiggling a little, almost like it was positioning itself comfortably, and it looked like it was hugging the tree like a bear. But then I saw the second \\\"bear\\\" in the SAME spot as this one in a tree right next to it. At this point I'm about 500 feet from these things and the trees they were in. I was able to take many photos of these \\\"bears\\\" and I have them on my phone and will send them to anyone who wants to see. On closer inspection, these were not bears. I showed a few friends and family and they all see what I see, it appears there is a UNIFORM Jet Black sillouette of a large, lean human man. When you see these pictures you will get an off/odd feeling. I know they weren't bears and I know they weren't humans. I'm not sure what they were, but I know what they were not. After viewing them for about a minute my girlfriend began to get a bit worried they might come down, so we left. And we didn't talk about it much as she isn't interested in the subject.

I didn't sleep well that night.  I had a feeling I was being watched and was uneasy. Breaking camp the next morning, Van went for water coming from an artesian spring in the wall of the canyon.  He found one very clear bigfoot footprint in the wet sand below the spring, about 80 feet from where we'd camped.  He called to me to come over and see.  My first reaction was this was a hoax.  Van and I examined the footprint in detail.  It was about 17 inches in length, with 5 clear toes and pressed down about 2 1/2 inches in the sand.  There was a musty smell in the area but this wasn't overpowering.  Van concluded the print was real based upon the fact it had rained hard the previous morning and you could see the pattern of the rain drops on the surface of the sand except where the footprint was.  Also whatever had the print may very well be slightly above us at the end of the bluff in some rock outcroppings.  He suggested we get out of there while the getting was good.

I was really surprised to read that report, since it could even have been the same incident reported by someone else.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"In late August of 1981 I heard a distinct distant wailing animal call similar in character to some of the recordings posted on the BFRO website. I was backpacking with two other people in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, near the northern boundary of Kings Canyon National Park. About a year later I wrote down a very detailed description of the event. I have always wanted to report this to some appropriate organization, so now that I have found the BFRO site, here it is. I was 16 at the time of the event. I am now 37. The following is a refined version of a description I wrote one year after the event. I was on a backpacking trip with two family friends who were about my parent's age. Our destination was the Devil's Punchbowl in California's Sierra Nevada mountains which is about a 19-mile hike on good trails from the parking lot at Courtright Reservoir. [You can find a topo map of the area at http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?z=11&n=4112372&e=335727&s=50&size=m] The first night we camped at a place called Long Meadow. The second day was a long hike to Fleming Lake (elevation about 9600 feet,) where we made camp just before sunset. Our camp was at the northeast corner of the lake, about 50 yards from the shore, up against a low, steep granite slope. We were the only people camped at that lake that evening. The two adults set about making dinner, and I went fishing at the lake since the fish were jumping vigorously. I started at the point on the lakeshore that was closest to the campsite and worked my way around the north edge of the lake towards the west. It was starting to get dark, the wind was virtually calm, and it was so quiet and peaceful that I could clearly hear occasional sounds from camp about 100 yards away: talking and the clinking of cookware. I was really focused on the fishing since I was very eager to catch something before it got too dark. I was changing a lure when I heard the sound. It was a distant wailing coming from the north/northeast, up a broad open valley, to my left. Fleming Creek runs through this valley. This call is very hard to describe, but one could describe it as human- or primate-like in its smooth, round character. The call was broken up into segments that rose and fell in pitch. Each segment lasted about 1.5 seconds and each followed immediately after the one before it, like \\\"oooOOo, oooOOo, oooOOo\\\" with the pitch and volume rising in the middle of each segment and trailing off abruptly at the end. There were about six segments in the call, making the total call length about 10 seconds. The sound was somewhere between an \\\"oooo\\\" and a \\\"wow\\\" sound. I froze immediately upon hearing this. It did not really scare me, but it commanded all of my attention. I heard it very clearly though it was faint and obviously far away. I would guess its origin could have been anywhere from one to two miles away, up the valley to the north/northeast. As I said it was very calm that evening and sound carries far in conditions like that. The call stopped after the first six \\\"oooOOo\\\" segments, and I immediately and very consciously decided that I was hearing things and ignored it and went back to working on my lure. Then I heard it again and there was no ignoring it. There was a total of five or six very clear, distinct calls made up of about five or six \\\"oooOOo\\\" segments each. The entire event lasted maybe 45 seconds or a minute. Once the second call started I stopped what I was doing and listened very carefully as the call repeated. I was definitely not hearing things. It was not the wind, since the breeze was barely a whisper. I was in an open meadow with a lake immediately in front of me and a tree-covered granite mountain behind me. The sound was not echoing, as there was nothing for it to echo against, and the sound did not trail off as it repeated as an echo does. It started and stopped very deliberately. This spooked me and I packed up all my fishing gear and went back to camp. I told the others that I had heard an animal call of some kind and asked them if they had heard anything but they had not. My guess is that the sound was masked by the noises from their own activities and the steep but low granite slope behind them. I forced myself not to think about it much, since we still had four nights to spend out there and we were headed deeper into the mountains. I did not hear, see, feel, or smell anything unusual for the rest of the trip, though I was pretty keyed up and attentive after that. Regarding the quality of the sound: About a month after I got back from the trip I read in John Green's book \\\"On the Track of the Sasquatch\\\" the description of the Puyallup recordings from 1973. It describes very well the quality of the call I heard: The unidentified noise is not an \\\"eeeee\\\" scream, but more of a long \\\"whooOooOooOoo\\\" or \\\"whoopwhoopwhoop\\\" at a high pitch and with immense volume. Heard from a distance it can be compared with the sound of a siren far off but it definitely is not that. When I first read that I got chills all over and I felt a little shocked, since that is an extremely good way to describe what I heard. I recently found your website and listened to all the supposed Sasquatch sound recordings, and the sound I heard could easily have been made by the same source. But the sounds on your website are mostly long wails or howls, and what I heard undulated up and down fairly rapidly. The voice itself sounded like a cross between the 1973 Puyallup sounds and the 1993 Del Norte County \\\"angry Bigfoot\\\" scream. But what I heard did not sound in the least threatening. In retrospect, it seemed as if the caller were simply announcing to everyone that it was present. Though there were multiple calls, they all seemed to come from the same source, from the same direction. I did not hear anything that sounded like an answer. To my mind there is no way this could have been a person unless they were playing with an amplifier. The noise was obviously far away and I find it hard to believe anyone (short of an opera singer) could project a call like that over such a distance. There were not that many people out there anyway. Since then I have heard coyotes, owls, horses, donkeys, grouse, and other animals in the wild, and they don't sound anything at all like what I heard. I have never to my knowledge heard a cougar, so I guess that is a possibility. I have heard that there could have been elk in that area, but I have listened to several elk bugles on the Web, and none of them are remotely like what I heard. Those elk recordings sound like someone trying to make a sound on a saxophone for the first time (dry and squawking), and what I heard had a very smooth \\\"primate\\\" quality.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"It might be Shaver Lake, but it is hard to tell.

The coyote kept looking back as it ran as if it was frightened.The coyote looked at us but it was clearly focused on something behind it and it was scared. We thought at that time that that was odd.

Just as the sun was about to set, the horses, which aparently were tied up, became spooked.  When the men looked around to see what was spooking them they noticed a tall figure, some distance away, standing next to a tree.  The men were apparently also scared enough to leave, and camp elsewhere for the night. When they returned the next day, they went over to a tree that the figure had been standing by.  They judged the height of the figure to be over seven feet tall by the bottom branch on the tree that had been just over the figures head.  I didn't really take the story to seriosly at the time.  I had heard it many years before my experience.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"My friend Greg and I had been fishing the San Juaquin river just below Florence Lake until about 6:30 or 7:00 pm.  As we live in Clovis Ca. appoximately 70 miles away, we had decided we would just camp up there for the night.  Kaiser Pass road is a narrow one lane road that traverses some very rugged area.  It takes almost 2 hours to travel the 20 miles back to state highway 168 at Huntington Lake.  So it is about a three and a half hour trip home.  A trip that niether of us wanted to drive after a long day fishing, especially at night.  As the area we were fishing in is notoriously bad for bears, we decided to drive to a camp spot that we were both familiar with just back up the way From Florence Lake.  The camp spot is not in a campground, and is just a single spot off to the side of the road.  But it is a well used spot by many people.  We set up camp, had dinner, and had just sat down next to the campfire.  The light of day was almost totally gone.  We were sitting across from one another as we had both been taught to do when in the wilderness, so you can see if any animals are coming up from behind the other person. Gregs back was to the car and the road.  My back was to a low rising granite out cropping, almost a dome like shaped out cropping that is flat on top.  about 50 yards beyond that is a rather steep dirt ledge that goes up maybe another 25 feet above where we were sitting.  I heard a noise that sounded like a horn on a train passing somewhere in the distance.  I even said to Greg, do you here that train in the distance.  he said yes , he heard it.  We continued to hear it for a while, when suddenly it dawned on both of us that we were at 9000 feet in elevation, and there are no trains for about 70 miles.  Now we were curious about the sound.  And that is how I would best describe it, as the horn on a train in the distance.  It was not an owl, I have heard many owls.  As we continued to listen, it became closer, and became clear that it was over or on the ledge behind me.  I moved to the car, and grabbed a 12 guage shotgun.  The last time we heard it, it was extremely close to us, but still had that low mono toned almost horn like sound.  Not knowing what we were dealing with, and not wanting to shoot someone or something, we called out a warning that we had a gun, just incase it was someone playing a prank.  We did not hear the sound again.  However, as we were both looking out toward the granite out cropping, and the ledge where the sound was coming from, we both turned and looked at each other at the very same time to ask if the other had just seen the same thing.  We had, a pair of eyes glowing in the distance.  Almost like cat eyes, but not yellow like cat eyes, they were more silver, or white.  We only saw them for a second.  Still not wanting to shoot at what I couldn't see, I fired a warning shot in the air.  I didn't here or see anything after that, however, Greg insists he saw the eyes again, even after I fired the shot. Not wanting to find out what isn't afraid of a twelve guage, Greg  threw all of our camping gear in the car as fast as he could while I stood guard with the gun.   We dumped our entire jug of water on the fire, got in the car and drove all the way home.  Niether of us said a word until we got back to town.  I have been all over the mountains up in that area, and have been camping and four wheeling into the back country since I was a kid.

But it then rose in volume and pich. it was like a babbling scream. It could almost sound like words, the screem lasted at least 30 seconds or more then rose to a shreak and ended abruptly.  It sounded as though it came from a point 50 or so yards from where we were standing, a thick grove of trees and deadfalls we call the island.  I could hear something moving in the trees and starting to circle the meadow we were in. IT screamed again and sounded as though it had moved to our right.  My cousin and I were shaken by the noise and we ran for the cook house. Sitting inside we heard it again and it sounded as  though it was now in the medow below us, but the darkness made it imposible to see anything. At this time we moved from the cooks cabin to a building we call the winter room.  We locked the door and spent the night there ( the room is bear proof and therefore safe). We heard it maybe five more times, around the ranch and once I was woken up at maybe three in the morning, by something outside our room. The next day I searched for tracks but the ground was frozen though it hadn't snowed yet. We found no tracks, but there was a hand print on the door of a store room where we keep food from bears during the summer.  The print of the palm was nearly as big as both my palms put together, and the fingers where as big as three of mine in length (this thing had long fingers).

The last time I heard it sounded like it was right behind me and I flinched then it must have seen me I heard it running away from me through the trees making the same noise and breaking limbs as it was running off. I stood in the same spot for about five minutes and did not hear it again. I walked out of the woods to my truck where my dad was waiting for me and we drove about a mile down the road to a campsite to eat lunch. At lunch I told my dad what happened and described the noise and he thought it might have been a buck grunting it sounded good to me since I never heard a buck grunt. So we decided that the buck might come back to that spot. So we ate lunch and drove back to the same spot. We hiked in and at the marshy part I told him to go in the direction that the deer ran to and I would try to spook them out again I waited for him to get out of site then I walked toward the pine trees, I got to the pines trees when I seen three does running in my direction toward the grove of trees in front of me, just before they got to the trees I heard the same noise again the expulsion of air and a branch break it spooked the deer two of them ran downhill and the last one ran uphill right at me it stopped within ten feet of me but it never seen me it was so frazzled by what it saw it stopped slowly turned around and tried to see around the tree to what had spooked it. It stood there for about one minute oblivious to me it then slowly turned around and started walking right at me it got within five feet of me then I flinched my arm so it would see me before it walked into me, it startled it so bad the deer fell down on its side did a spin on the ground and jumped up and ran the other way when it got around the tree and down about twenty yards I heard that noise again. The deer ran down and to the south and I seen it stop about 150 yards away through a clearing it would look at me then it would look at where the noise came from, it looked back and forth several times then it slowly walked away. I then followed where the deer had ran to see what was making that noise I walked very slowly came around the tree and about thirty yards down the tree line I saw a large figure with black hair sitting under a large pine tree sunning, it had large shoulders four to six inch hair but you could still see the muscular definition of its chest and shoulders there was a fallen tree blocking my view below its waistline.

I go to the Sierra Nevada Mountains about 1 and a half hours outside of Fresno, California.  Last summer around the time of the sighting, I made about 11 trips to numerous places. This is what I do.  I feel I have a good knowledge of the outdoors, and I have becomes quite at home in the wilderness. On Friday, July 14, 2006 my friends, Jason and one other person who has asked me to exclude his name from this report, started out on a backpacking trip to Hobler Lake in the John Muir Wilderness. We started off our hike a little late in the day, about 5:00 pm, on the Maxsom trailhead, just on the east side of Courtright Reservoir. We were hiking for about an hour, this being about 6:00 pm in the day.  It was dusk when we noticed something moving parallel to us in the woods.  It was hard to make out what it was because of the terrain consisting of dense wooded areas with evergreen trees.  It had a reddish brown color, and in the distance you could tell it was much bigger than a person was.  We assumed it was a black bear so we moved on. Whatever it was seemed quite interested in us.  Every time we stopped, it would stop moving as well.  This continued for about an hour until it got too dark to see clearly without a flashlight. We continued hiking to our destination for a while when I started hearing a crackling of branches to my left about 50 feet behind me, maybe less.  When I turned around, I saw a black outline of something looking at me from behind a tree.  I froze for a second because I was in such shock over what I was seeing.  Out of all the animals I\\u2019ve seen at night in the mountains, this had no resemblance.  It was standing on two legs, was about 7 and one half feet tall, and was 4 feet wide at the shoulders.  It had hardly no neck, and very long arms that hung down by its mid legs.  It also had a fluffy appearance like it had a thick long coat of fur. Then I whispered to my friend Jason to shine a flashlight on it.  As I said that, this thing must have heard me, because it turned around and started walking off somewhat fast.  At this time we decided to load our firearms, which weren\\u2019t much because all we had was a 40 caliber pistol and a 22 pistol.  For a time, whatever it was seemed to have left the area. We arrived at Hobler Lake around 10:00 pm.  We set up our camp, cooked some food, and rested for a bit.  I finally fell asleep about 11:30 pm, but Jason and my other friend stayed up. When I awoke in the morning, Jason told me that he and bob were by the lake having a cigarette when they heard large objects crashing in the water about 100 yards from them.  He described it a like something very large was jumping and thrashing in the water. The next day we were staying close to camp because of all that went on.  We walked about away from camp to explore the area when we heard noise from camp like the clinking of pots and stuff.

Then again, we heard that bellowing howl, and saw on top of the ridge a dark silhouette that looked like a bear standing on its hind feet.  I brought my rifle scope to my eye to take aim on this so-called bear.  As I looked through the scope, I realized it was no bear.  I thought it could have been a really tall man in some kind of camouflage suit, but it looked like no man that I have ever seen.  It ran down the hill and disappeared into the brush, like it was chasing the deer.  So we decided to go and track down this creature.  Once we arrived at where it was standing, there was a footprint in the dirt that made my footprint look like a child's footprint.  It was four times the size of mine. We never saw the creature again and never heard that howl, but then again, I've never gone back since then.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Shaver Lake\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"168\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Mountain ridge, pine forest with creeks and meadows in the area.\", \"COUNTY\": \"Fresno County\", \"DATE\": \"26\", \"SEASON\": \"Fall\", \"MONTH\": \"October\", \"YEAR\": \"2006\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"About 6:15 pm in low light.\"},\n",

My friend and I were bear hunting up in Humboldt County on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. It was in March or April. Back then bear hunting was open all year long in Humboldt County, and there were no limits. We were from Southern California, and were totally unfamiliar with the area. We stopped in a town on the Trinity river, I believe the name of the town may have been Willow Creek, I'm not sure. Anyway we met some Indians in town, and asked them, if they knew of any good places to hunt bear. They said they didn't, but added, that there was an old man in the grocery store who may be able to help us. The Indians pointed to an old blue 1950 Buick parked in front of the store, and told us that the car belonged to the old man, so we waited there until he came out. When he came back to his car, we introduced ourselves, and asked him if he knew of any good places to hunt bear. He told us it was pretty good up on the Hoopa Reservation, and gave us some general directions. We ended up on an old deserted dirt road high in the mountains in my friends dads 1949 (4) door Chevy. We kept going up until we hit snow, started to fishtail, and the right rear wheel went over the side. We set the hand brake and got out of the car to evaluate the situation. We decided to get the bumper jack out of the trunk, and jack the car up, and then push it off of the jack back on the road. The plan worked and all 4 wheels were back on the road. We backed down the road until we came to a place where we could turn around. By now it was dusk, and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark. At the turn around spot next to the road we saw a big pine tree and decided to set up camp under the tree. By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark. We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down, and were talking for about ten minutes, when we heard the first grunt outside the tent. We both pretended that we didn't hear anything and kept talking. Then it did it again, and this time we both stopped, and I asked my friend if he heard that. He said he did, and also heard it the first time. I said yeah, me too. Now, we both shut up and listened. We could hear it circling the tent, because the ground was covered with bark, and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet. We could also hear its very loud breathing. By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing, we figured whatever this was, it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet. It circled the tent several times, and we decided that one of us should go out and see what it was. Niether of us wanted to go out, because we were scared, so we decided to flip a coin to see which one of us would go. My friend lost. I then suggested that before he went out, it may be wise, to fire the 44 mag out of the tent flap first. He concurred, and stuck the barrel out of the flap and fired 5 shots. We then both went out, he had the 44, and I held the light. We looked all over and didn't see a thing. We went back in the tent, laid down, and were  trying to figure out what had just been outside of the tent. We had never heard of sasquatch. We had been talking for about 5 or 10 minutes when we heard a very loud high pitched scream, that lasted for about 5 seconds, and sounded like it was about 50 to 100 yards away. We looked at each other and asked, what the heck was that? That was one heck of a scream. We talked a little longer and then went to sleep. The rest of the night was un-eventful. We arose the next morning and went outside, and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints. We couldn't see any, because the ground was covered, with many years accumulation of bark from the huge pine tree we were camped under. We had wondered many times, what it was, that had been outside our tent that night and often talked about it. Then one day several years later, I happened to be in the barber shop, getting a haircut. I picked up an Argosy magazine, and it had the now famous controversial picture of the female sasquatch on the cover. I read the article, and in the article there was a map with an X on it. The X indicated where the picture was supposedly taken. The X on the map wasn't far from where we were camped that night. That's when I made the connection and since then after reading about many encounters I am pretty well convinced that the animal that we had heard outside of our tent 41 years ago was a sasquatch.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"I believe Willow Creek, Calif.\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Deserted and very remote narrow dirt road.\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"It was in the mountains just along side a dirt road that was on a ridge.

I was far ahead of my friends and decided to scare them as they came up the trail so I climbed up some rock cliffs for a better advantage and settled down within some Huckleberry bushes to wait for my friends.  After things quieted down I noticed a heavy smell and started looking around.  The breeze was blowing straight from the brush behind me and I felt the hair on my neck starting to rise up. My two friend were nowhere in sight.  I noticed a small movement in the berry bushes right behind me.  I stood up ready to run when this thing stood up also.  It didn't hesitate but turned and walked off into the brush.  I heard trees snapping and the crunch of dry leaves echo away as I ran back to my friends who were still two hundred yards away.  After I calmed down we went back to the spot to look for some sign.  They believed I saw a bear but I know what I saw.  We found where something was squatted down and stripping berries.

At the time that I saw these tracks, though, I new little or nothing about bigfoot.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"I grew up in the woods of the Pacific Northwest.  My father also grew up there. He was born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, but grew up in the eastern SF Bay Area.  He has a BS in Forestry, A Masters in Zoology, and A PHD in Entomology, and worked as a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service.  For most of his 20-30 years of service, my father did research on insects that predate timber harvest species in California and Oregon.  When he did his research (usually in the summer and fall) my younger brother and I would accompany him into the woods.  My father was and is a great woodsman, a hunter and fisherman, who taught my brother and myself all about the forests and what types of plants and animals lived there.  My father was also a man of science and this is important to note as will become evident later. At the end of each summer season, my family and some other forestry families would get together and take several weeks of vacation.  Most often, we would load canoes and float down the lower 15-30 miles of the Klamath River to its mouth.  My father and I would fly fish for steelhead in the riffles during mornings and evenings and we would spend the hot hours of the day canoeing, exploring, resting, etc. These trips would often take one to two weeks to complete.  During one of these trips (probably in 1969 or 1970, I was about 8-9 years old I think...) we made camp on the river bar at the mouth of Tek-Tah creek.  There was a good flat bar there, and at that time of year, the creek was flowing under the sand and apeared dry. One afternoon, while everyone else was napping, my father and I took a walk up the creek bed to see if the creek was flowing on the surface somewhere inland.  About two hundred yards upsteream, the creek did come to the surface and flowed sluggishly thruogh a series of large pools. I remember my dad telling me that these pools were probably full of baby salmon and steelhead waitng for fall rains to allow them to swim down to the main river and out to sea.  My dad had a very scientific mind and he would describe natural processes in great detail when we had the patience to listen. As we proceeded inland up the creek, we rounded a bend and entered a long, sandy bar on the east side of a long arching pool in the creek. As I looked across the surface of this bar, I saw a set of tracks in the soft sand. These tracks caught my attention because they were very large, and the space between them seemed very long, like if I laid down next to them, they would almost be further apart than the legth of my body.  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad, who is pretty big (6',2\\\"). The tracks began at the water's edge at the lower end of the bar, and proceeded diagonally across the bar in a straight line to the far end of the bar. My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was \\\"unknown\\\" until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge, I had not heard of any such animal at that time, nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then, but these tracks...thier size, gait, and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me.  My father was also very interested in the tracks, he asked me please not to walk near or in them, then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them, and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them.  He seemed very tense, as if he sensed something, or was trying to figure something out.  Eventually, I got bored of sitting and got up and followed him. When I finally caught up with him, we were half-way up the bar.  He had stopped looking at the tracks and was instead looking intently at the timber ahead and at the southern edge of the bar.  He was very quiet and tense.  I have never seen my father frightened or worried about anything before, or since for that matter, but watching him the way he scanned the surrounding forest so intently, made me very nervous and excited.  I broke the silence and began to ask him what he thought made the tracks and what was he trying to see in the trees...He turned around, almost jumping a little in suprise, and told me to be quiet.  then he looked around some more, and started back towards the camp with a qick pace, grabbing me by the hand, and saying these are the tracks of a big bear, son, and we should leave this area alone from now on.  Then he told me not to come up the creek alone, and not to tell Mama or my brother or any of the others anything about what we saw, that it might worry them or something, and that he would speak no more of this matter.  Just like that! Well the older I get the funnier that incident and those tracks seem to me. I have hunted for many years and have seen and tracked many animals in the woods since that time, and have never seen anything like that since.  I am thirty eight now, and my father has retired. I asked my father about this incident last year, and he was silent and pensive for a long time, then he told me that he does'nt remember this time or seeing anything other than bear tracks.

I did not even look to see what it was. I just sprinted the rest of the way back to camp and did not say anything. We were having a good time listening to loud rock and roll music (car stereo with trunk open) and drinking beer when a friend of mine said to me, \\\"Do you smell that ... what is it??\\\" Well ... I had been noticing this odor but had not said anything. It smelled like a cross between an oil refinery (very sulfurish) and had an animal musk smell to it and was VERY VERY strong. I recognized the animal muskiness from my trapping days as a youth, so I told my friend, \\\"This is an animal.\\\" My friend said it smelled like diesel fuel and put out his cigarette it smelled so strong. This smell was so strong that it seemed that it had to be right in front of your face. We figured it was coming from a particular stand of trees and decided to walk up and behind this stand to see if we could still smell it. When we got behind the stand we couldn't smell it but when we got back around down-wind of the stand we heard something take off downhill and down-wind of us. All we saw was swaying brush where it had gone crashing down the mountain side. Some of the guys wanted to chase it but I convinced them that since it had left that we should leave it alone if it left us alone. Well ... in 15 minutes the smell was back. This time everybody in camp grabbed a gun ... we had a lot of guns and decided to chase this smelly thing down. Except for me and 2 others. I just had a flashlight. Well ... they chased this thing out of the aforementioned stand of trees and could hear it and smell it but could not see it. We could hear it stomping and thrashing around behind the stand of trees. They chased it up a narrow trail that led to a spring. I was bringing up the rear but only had the flashlight so I went back to camp with the other 2 that had remained. We could hear the \\\"hunting party\\\" about 50 or 60 yards up this narrow difficult trail yelling \\\"He's right up here ... there he is!!!!\\\" Then the yelling stopped for a few seconds then they started screaming. They came running out of the forest single file screaming in fear. They said the could hear and smell what they were chasing but could not see it and then suddenly there was no sound or smell. At this point they decided that whatever it was had stepped off of the trail and they had run right by it. Well this freaked them out and explains their hasty retreat. It was quiet the rest of the night but a couple of mornings later 2 of the guys were sleeping in a 2-man tent on a hillside above the camp and woke the rest of us at first light, yelling. When we got to the tent we found a huge turd about 18 inches from the front of the tent opening.

Again, with the incident at Richardson Grove, the dog actually stood up on its hindlegs and \\\"walked\\\" while lunging forward up a steep bank dragging my friend who weighed about 170 lbs with it in its pursuit of the thing that left big footprints.

We didn't want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two Malamute-cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many back-country adventures. As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep. Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from \\\"childlike\\\" to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I've had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation. We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning. The second \\\"experience\\\" I had at Avenue of the Giants was with the same friend while we were hiking a trail there. It was again the Fall of 1985 about a month later than the first. We had a map with us and decided to cut a loop short by going cross-country through the dense redwood forest. Not long after we got started, the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline. We reached the top and noticed large foot-shaped impressions (maybe 14-18 inches long and 8-10 inches wide) in the duff below.

I told her it was her imagination when all of a sudden from that direction came this yell or howl that made my skin crawl. It!! started what seemed to be a good distance off in the thick forest and then moved rapidly closer. What startled me was the speed at which the source of the sound traveled. The howl itself sounded halfway between a human voice yelling \\\"Ahhhhhh\\\" and the high pitched sound of an elk. It wasn't an elk or human or bear as near as I can tell though and what ever it was moved very fast. We didn't see anything though but we got the distinct feeling weren't welcome in the area.

But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \\\"Where did it occur?\\\" section of this report. I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \\\"B\\\" then bellow \\\"Whoooooooop\\\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard. To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That's not what this was. Well, I didn't think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn't focus on it at first, I wasn't sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad. As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn't move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from the thigh up, it didn't move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn't see its eyes. These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high. As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area. I don't follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I'm not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.

I finally realized what it probably was and what it was doing. It had a human-like torso (from the waist up) and it appeared as if it was scratching its back against the stump. I gained a back and profile view before I could no longer overcome the intense fear I was experiencing. I urged my son as serious as could, to run as fast as he could. After running for about thirty seconds to a minute, we stopped. I wanted badly to go back and investigate, but understood I could not do this with my son.

All had been sleeping but awoke nearly simultaneously prior to the final sounds as if a previous sound had awakened us from sleep.\", \"ALSO_NOTICED\": \"Again, please take note of the fact that we broadcast the alleged Bigfoot screams and howls (available on the BFRO site) immediately prior to our three mile hike to Fish Lake; approximately 6:30 p.m.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"John Freitas of BFRO was kind enough to allow us to borrow his broadcasting sound equipment for the duration of our camping trip. We broadcast the alleged Sasquatch \\\"screams\\\" and \\\"howls\\\" throughout the next few days, including the Bluff Creek Road areas. Note: Before leaving the truck at the locked Forest Service gate, the Fish Lake Road, and hiking to Fish Lake, we broadcast two calls of each sound, the \\\"scream\\\" and the \\\"howl\\\". Coincidentally, our encounter occurred that same evening. At approximately 9:30 p.m., we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party), and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of \\\"whistle\\\" or double \\\"whoop\\\" (try whistling these syllables \\\"WEEOOOU, WEEOOOU\\\") and it was immediately followed by a very intense \\\"screech\\\", which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman! Now, I grew up in the mountains of Montana, am familiar with many animals and their sounds, and have never heard anything like this in my life. And until this moment, I have wondered what it was like to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I have never felt this kind of reaction, I repeat -- NEVER. The sound sequence repeated itself again, followed by a third lone screech. Immediately, we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal's eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on, we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner. Then at about 12:30 a.m. (just past midnight, with two of the teenagers already asleep), we again heard the \\\"whistle - whoop\\\" immediately followed by the \\\"screech\\\", but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again, we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2,000,000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still, NOTHING. No movement, no eyes, nothing. After panning around the entire area once again, I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox, or kit fox. Well, for our needs, that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny, but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night. At approximately 5:30 a.m., three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the \\\"whistle - whoop\\\" followed immediately by the intense \\\"screech\\\" and this followed again by a lone \\\"screech\\\". But, this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat, but agreed it's just that darn kit fox again, and didn't bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this \\\"chased\\\" it away), but we then heard the same \\\"whistle\\\" and \\\"screech\\\" again, but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter. The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps. We did not SEE any movement or eyes of any kind and we did not SMELL anything at all. After hiking out of Fish Lake the next day, and driving back to the coast, we just didn't feel right with our \\\"kit fox\\\" explanation. It just didn't sit right with us. The sound was just too intense. Then, upon discussing the incident with John Freitas that same evening, he agreed with the idea that foxes almost NEVER even make sounds, much less something as nerve-wracking as that of the night before. On our trip back south, we stopped for a break and found a poster-type map discussing the numerous Bigfoot sightings and locations and in the accompanying paragraph it stated that \\\"... sounds associated with bigfoot encounters include whistles and shrieks similar to that of a mountain lion.\\\" We welcome your feedback on discussing these sounds.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Weitchpec\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Bluff Creek Road off of Hwy. 96\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Lake shore Forest Service campground (our site approximately 150 yards from shore), paved roads throughout, surrounded by thickly-wooded Northern California pine forests.

This area we were in had a sighting last year around the month of July. The place where we decided to set up was a recent clear-cut that ran along the hillside.   It was about 1000 feet wide and 1200 feet long.   On the edges were fir and oak trees that developed  a thick cover.   Running the width and centered in the clear-cut was a dirt road that the local people and loggers used on a daily basis.   It also provided us with a place to park and set up our sound equipment.   it also became base for our team. From our base, looking down into the valley about two miles we could see the town of Johnson.   From or point we were about 1500 feet above the river and town. Just prior to dusk, I had two members climb to the top of the clear-cut (about 150 feet in elevation and about 300 feet away from base).   I did this so if anything was to come closer to our base camp, they would have the best field of vision, and with their night vision device would be able to determine what it was.   We also had two way potable radios for the upper lookout and base. Manny and myself continued to set up the equipment and waited until nightfall. Because I was scheduled to participate at 10:00 PM in a live broadcast with Jeff Rense \\u201cSightings\\u201d program, I was insuring that my bag cell phone was working properly.   All the equipment checked out other than the phone worked but had some static in the line. At 9:40 we started to broadcast.   The sound traveled very well, and seemed to echo forever.   The location we were at easily helped the sound to travel well over five miles from valley to ridge top, and saddle, it covered a large area.   Very happy with the sound, we continued to broadcast a few more times before the Sightings show started. It was almost 10:00 PM when the phone rang, it was the Sightings show.   The show went fine for the first few minutes, but the static was getting horrendous, cutting Jeff Rense off completely at times.   About ten minutes into this show, Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection. I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line, with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down, not much protection in anyone\\u2019s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone, I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second, and again I heard this charging, that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didn\\u2019t have a radio, as we were together at base camp and had to share two, one for base and one for the upper team). I asked the upper team \\u201cdo you see anything\\u201d and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out, as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny). The show continued on and I would hear footfalls, breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight, but didn\\u2019t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was. Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety, not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  \\u201cJohn it\\u2019s looking right at you, can\\u2019t you see it, it\\u2019s about 25 feet away, that ****** is huge\\u201d.   My heart started pounding FAST, and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder. The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at, it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car, cell phone to one ear, and the other to the forest, I could hear it charge again, and that\\u2019s when they would say, \\u201cit went back into the trees\\u201d, this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes, with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others. This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking, lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life. That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition, it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area, it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view, it had several windows to look at me, and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me.

Site #1: On second day (10? July) I was checking the north side of the streambed about 1/2 mile southeast of our campsite the (Wright Place) when I noticed a flat glade of trees on the south bank and walked across to investigate. After a few minutes in the glade I found a cedar tree with the top twisted off at the 7.5 to 8 foot level. Here the tree was about 2\\\" thick. Most alarming was that the break, and part of the tree where bark was stripped off, looked moist and fresh; probably occurring overnight, given the dry, and warm conditions. The top of the tree, with a few feet of stripped bark was at the tree's base. No hairs found. I took pictures and brought the top back to my brother.

While living in Takilma Oregon, in my cabin on the Illinois River, I heard a call sounding exactly like a great ape out of a zoo.  On another night, when I was in Young\\u2019s Valley California I heard a hooting call repeated several times coming from Preston Peak area, this also sounded exactly like a great ape out of a zoo.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"In 1978, I was alone and gold hunting up behind the Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation. I had to take a side trip across the mountain to avoid some heavy snow and brush. I found this trail that was going up the mountain, where their were large steps in the trail that were throwing my climbing stride off. At this point, this side of the mountain, that I was on, was bald and it was open ground with no trees or brush close by to hide behind. Suddenly, I had this very bad feeling. Then the hair on the back of my neck stood up straight up!  I never had that happen to me before or since.  I believe this happened for no other reason except fear.  I then left this out of stride trail. Actually, I ran off the trail feeling terrified of something that was coming down this same trail.  I only got a short way off, when I went down on my knees and covered my face and eyes with both hands and tried to hide. At that moment I heard an animal on two legs come down the trail, a few yards from me, it stop and it had to gaze right at me for awhile, then it continued on down the hill.  I didn't look until after it left and continued on down the mountain out of sight. So, I never saw this animal.  I believe this creature was directing a silent feeling toward me, and I complied. At this point in my life, I had been a seasoned mountain man, and have had numerous encounters with many kinds of animals including bears and deer, day and night, but nothing like this. With no more fear I returned to the trail feeling fine. I thought of bigfoot right away. This time I paid close attention to detail.  There was no odor or smell, and the only odd thing was that the trail became fainter, as I continued to climb on up this mountain. I had expected this trail lead to somewhere, like a cave perhaps, but no, it just ended at a small meadow.  I looked all around, and I could see there was a lime stone ridge out-cropping in the distance, but no signs of a cave. This encounter was really something to remember, and it was my experience.

He is a very experienced hunter and outdoorsman with a degree in wildlife biology and he had never heard anything like it. Anyway, we were walking up the north bank, where the trails are, when I decided to cross to the south bank to check out some sandbars. I loaded up my girlfriend on my back and waded across. We then continued upstream a shortways when we came across three distinct footprints. They were approximately 14 1/2 inches long. I measured them with a stick that I saved. I compared them with my own barefoot track for depth and they were nearly twice as deep. I weigh about 280 lbs. I was surprised that they weren't wider, they were almost narrow for their length. I at first thought they were human because of this.  The best print had 5 very distinct toes and was flat, no arch at all, with toes straighter across than a normal human. It appeared that it had just leisurely walked into the creek. I scoured up and down for an exit point but the terrain wasn't suitable for tracks other than the odd sand bar.

We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host's site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive \\\"skunky\\\" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time. Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct \\\"hoots\\\" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. \\\"There.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you hear it that time?\\\" \\\"No.\\\" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of \\\"hoots\\\". \\\"What do you think that is?\\\" he asked. I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond. As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard \\\"whacking\\\" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this \\\"hooting\\\" and \\\"whacking\\\" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area. The \\\"whacking\\\" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: \\\"What do you think that is?\\\" I gave the guarded response: \\\"I'll tell you what, I've spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I've never heard anything like this.\\\" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word \\\"Bigfoot\\\" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive. Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the \\\"whacking\\\"; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer \\\"whacks\\\" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm \\\"whack\\\" from our South/Southwest. I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note \\\"whistles\\\" from the general direction of the distant, hollow \\\"whacking\\\" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a \\\"crack\\\" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual \\\"whacking\\\") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings. In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the \\\"amphitheater\\\" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that \\\"skunky\\\" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk. At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger's Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully. We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4\\\" in width) to a point about 6\\\" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression. That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night. We returned home however with a new awareness.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Orleans\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"96\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Mountainous, steep, rocky terrain.

The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp, takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m, just as it got dark, we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said,\\\"WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT\\\"? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness, another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m, we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was, it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would've left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did'nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts, they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example: the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts, they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment, a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself,\\\"thats what we heared at Onion Lake\\\". The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone, roughness, length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5, 2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I'm not a scientist or expert on grunts, but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County, California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5, 2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Weitchpec\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Forest Service Road 13N01\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Mountain Ridge with large Douglas Fir Trees.

I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. I\\u2019m from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area.

And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didn\\u2019t move for a good bit, because I was in shock.

They were on the trail behind me coming down.\", \"ALSO_NOTICED\": \"Broken twigs, brush and some hair on them.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"Yes, according to the Bigfoot encounter web site, a person contacted me to tell me of a similar incident during 2000 by some business men out of Bishop, Ca.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"I do not know whom to contact but I have a story to tell. My name is J. C. and I am a 41 year old Vice President of a bank. I have been harboring an encounter I had for 31 years secretly out of fear of ridicule or shame. But now that I have seen other people have had similar situations, I must tell my story. During September 1972, I was hiking down from a lake with my dad and my friend on a fishing trip. We were at a place called Barney Lake out of Mammoth, California, and were on our way home. After a weekend of camping and fishing we were backpacking out from the lake. I was the lead person going down the trail. I had outpaced my friend J. C. and my dad by about 4 minutes without knowing it as I was moving quickly down the trail. After about 10 to 40 minutes down the trail from Barney Lake (I can't remember exactly after all these years) I came into a clearing. It was a small flat grassy meadow from the trees which I had been seeing downhill till then. I took a break to rest from my fast strides and looked out over the meadow. The first thing I saw was a big white rock boulder near the end of the meadow. The meadow was maybe 20 yards by 30 yards of grass. At the point of the clearing to my left I heard extreme thrashing going on. I looked over to my left to see a large animal bent over with its rear end facing me. It was only about 12 feet away from me. I saw that it was hairy and had a reddish, orange, brown multicolor mix hair to it, and most different was a rear end that was bare like a monkey's. I knew this because at this time in my life I spent most of my lunch hours in the library reading zoology and marine biology books. I thought this was very strange because no bear could bend over at the waist and have skin over its rear end like this. In my fear I was frozen, shocked and bewildered at the same time. I had never known or heard of big foot or sasquatch at this time in my life. At this point it had been maybe 5 or 6 seconds and then the animal lifted up and stood erect. It was enormous. It must have been 8 feet tall or more, and for a 10 year old boy this was unreal. It had been scratching with its hands and grubbing and digging prior to looking for what I thought was food. Its back was to me when it stood so I could see it was built similar to a human but with a lot of hair. I knew this was no bear from my background. I also knew only black bear were seen as an almost extinct species here during this time, and would have been much smaller in height and stature. I got so scared I ran full pack towards that big white rock. I literally dove over the top, pack and all, and snuggled against the rock, so scared to even look, in case the creature heard me. Finally after about 20 seconds or so, I peeked over the rock to see nothing and no one on the trail. Within 1 or 2 minutes, my dad and John came down the trail and into the opening. I started screaming at them \\\"look out, look out,\\\" in fear that the creature was still there and would do something to them. They froze,  bewildered, looked left to where I was pointing and then back to me in confusion. They were standing at the clearing at the spot I had been at. I finally came out and walked to them and looked into the trees and thick brush only to see broken brush, twigs and some hair there. We moved on finally and I never spoke of this again except to my dad and a couple of close friends. Around 7 or 8 years late I saw a couple of bigfoot movies including the Patterson video. Once I saw this, I knew without a doubt this was what I saw. I still kept my story a secret out of fear, but this vision haunts me and will all my life. I know it was so real. I will never forget this and take it to my grave. I am now someone who needs answers and must try and find out that this creature does exist or I will not put my memory to rest. I know what I saw was no figment of my imagination or hoax. I want to seek it out.

When I was 10 years old, my father decided I was strong enough for a long excursion in the wilderness, and we set off for a place called Seven Lakes near Big Pine. We had hiked for a few days when we came to the sixth lake, and we could see the seventh lake just beyond it. Seventh lake was covered with ice and there was snow all around just past where we decided to camp for the night. We thought this would be a good place to stay and explore the next day. During the night a snow storm hit and it became freezing cold, so my father and I put our sleeping bags over us and huddled together for warmth. I kept looking at my father's watch and hitting the light on it to see when we could expect the sun to rise so we could get warm. It was 3:45 a.m when we heard footsteps walking up the trail towards us. Our tent was right on the edge of the trail, and whatever was out there walking was on two feet and very big, we could almost feel the ground shake as it got closer. My father and I looked at eachother in silence, both of us a bit shocked by what we were hearing. It walked right up to our tent and stood there for about five minutes, completely silent. I have very good senses and I could feel that whatever it was absolutely didn't want us there. I could feel its anger resonating, I can't explain how, but I got the most scary feeling in my heart. It wanted us to leave. Then it walked off just as suddenly as it came, but it headed in the direction of the frozen lake, and beyond that the trail went into very rugged wilderness. I didn't think it was a person because it had no flashlight, was very large, and only an idiot would continue walking on the trail into the wilderness at that time of night, in the middle of a snowstorm. My father and I were quite frightened by our nightime visitor, and when first light hit we instantly broke camp and headed down the mountain without making breakfast, nor saying a word to eachother. We both knew we had to get out of there. Unfortunately, we were so far in the wilderness that we had to camp again that night further down the mountain, but this time we were not visited luckily. My father has a MBA and is a successful businessman, very well liked and trusted in his community. To this day we still talk about the incident from time-to-time, and we still don't know what it was. At the time the incident happened, I was so scared I didn't even think to look for tracks, and I don't think I wanted to.

However I can relate some of this information to you and even put you in touch with two of the possible three people, can't guarantee they will talk with you about the sighting, but one never knows. In fact I spoke with my ex-brother in-law about this earlier this evening because I happened upon your website and explored it.  What is very significant is that Sam and Don had every opportunity to shoot this animal and/or person and thought about it, but could not because it looked to human! Only THREE DAYS later Big Foot reports hit the news. My father and Sam AKA Sandy, in front of me took a forest map out and Sam became quiet as the new sightings were only 15 miles from his encounter, and in the direction the creature was traveling. The newer sightings as I recall put the creature near Pear Blossum, CA on the other side of the mountains. I remember a news report of 1000 people lined up across the desert looking for anything and they did find some hair on a barbwire fence. To this day I know of no one having reported this first encounter three days prior. Another significant item is that in those days bear season and deer season overlaped or was one in the same. At first they thought this might be a deforemed bear (they had bear tags) as they witnessed this being walking on two legs just like any human and appeared to be 7 to 8 feet tall. They were a few hundred yards away on the other side of the caynon, (don't remember the name of the caynon) but their rifle scopes allowed them to see this clearly enough that viewing the face and shape they could not decide if this was an animal or a human. I remember Sandy/Sam saying it looked like a monkey man. The animal/person seemingly did not know they were there. They had bear tags and thought about shooting the creature but as I said could not make themselves do it. I recall Sam telling my father that it had to be a bear because it dropped to all fours when it climbed the steeper terrain. My father asked Sam: How did you guys climb it? The reply was the same as the deformed bear. About then my brother in-law was no longer jovial regarding the sighting and preffered not to discuss the incident. Until now I have more or less left the man alone about it. Today he is a Plant Manager for a large trailer company. Don still lives in Baldwin Park, CA but maybe moving to San Diego, CA. I seldom cross paths with Don nor have I never pursued the matter with him. If you folks are interested I can put you in touch with both of them but you may have to settle for what I have related.

I'm assuming we rested for awhile, and I remember just talking and hanging out. As we were getting up and ready to go, we heard a strange noise coming from the bushes nearby. We stopped talking and listened, and it was a very low sort of growl/snuffling sound.

The bushes along the trail there were very high, such that we couldn't see through them. It scared the hell out of us and so we quickly hoofed it back down the trail.

My friend was just out of boot camp USMC and we started hiking as often as time would allow. We were hiking down a small stream bed that went down hill. The stream was all dried up and it was mostly rock hopping until we got to the bottom of the hill, at one point there is a small section off to the side that is just dirt and makes for a much easier walk down to the bottom. When we got to the bottom we hiked a bit more but as the sun started to go down, we headed back up the same hill/creek bed. I followed my own boot tracks back up as I was tired of rock hopping, while going up, the smell in the air was horrible, like rotten eggs or portable toilet, I then noticed on one of my tracks laid a dead ground squirrel, right over my boot track. I pointed this out to my friend and as soon as I did this, a loud banging over a short hill side was heard, it was coming from about 35-50 yards away from us. It sounded as if it was a large log being hit against a tree. I looked at where the noise was coming from and noticed the tops of the trees were swaying back and forth; all this time of the swaying of the trees the pounding on them could be heard. Then the pounding stopped and a loud groan/scream was heard from the same area as the pounding of the trees. I have never heard anything like it. I\\u2019ve heard Mt Lion, Black bear, this was nothing like that, and was very-very loud, to the point is was damn scary. My friend asked if we should look over the small hillside to see what was making the noise. I said no way, and he agreed. When we started walking away the banging and screaming would stop, but as soon as we stopped it would proceed with the groan and screaming and the trees would start swaying.

Many footprints in the area on the day following the event.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"No.\", \"STATE\": \"California\", \"OBSERVED\": \"First, as a matter of background, I want to tell a little about myself. It will help explain the delay in ever having reposted this incident. The sighting occurred about three months prior to my entering the United States Army. I served for three years as a Paratrooper with a Top Secret Clearance. After my time in the service, I became a Los Angeles Police officer. I did that for thirteen years and am now a Federal Agent, working for an O.I.G. out of Washington DC. With that background, you can probably understand my reluctance to discuss this sighting with too many people. It really boils down to a potential career killer. That being said\\u2026 the incident DID occur and I remember it vividly. Many many years after the event, I reconnected with my friend (the witness) and asked him to tell ME the story as he recalled it. I wanted to check my memory and see if his matched mine. It did\\u2026. To a T! Only a few months ago, I spoke with my brother in law, a witness after the fact. I asked him if he remembered the event\\u2026. He did. It should be known that he is not the kind of person that would \\\"buy into\\\" such a story, had he not been semi involved. Anyway, this is what happened: My friend Craig and I were both 17 years old and waiting to leave for Army Basic Training. He was due to leave in June and I would go in August of 1980. We were staying with my Sister and Brother in Law at the time. They lived in a cabin in Green Valley California. Craig and I enjoyed our last months as civilians in that area, and used it to train for the difficult training ahead of us. We ran every day along the mountain roads and hiked the hills, trying to get into prime shape. In May, we decided to test ourselves and camp out for a full seven days. We knew the perfect place for this would be what we called \\\"The old campground\\\" because of its isolated surroundings and terrain that would be perfect for climbing and hiking. So, we packed up a weeks worth of supplies and, though my sister Cindy and her husband Tom offered to drive us, we decided to act like soldiers and walk to the location. We did this with full packs. My sister and Tom advised us that they would check on us at least every other day and that they would bring us food and lemonade and such. Tom also, offered to provide us with two weapons to be used for protection against any strangers that may try to harm us. After all\\u2026 this was before cell phones and we would be on our own big-time. There was also a heavy rattlesnake threat in that area, so we happily took him up on the offer. Tom met us at an area near the mine shafts later that day and gave us an M-1 rifle and a 12 gauge shotgun, with ammo for both. The dirt trail that leads off of the main highway goes very far back into the mountains. In fact, were you to traverse it to its end, you would end up on top of what is known as Grass Mountain. Craig and I decided to get about three miles in and away from the highway, which was about a mile past what once was an old 1920s campground, and live deep in the bush like soldiers would. We found a great spot, next to a clear running creek and set up our tent in the clearing that was there. This clearing was completely surrounded by thick woods. Then\\u2026\\u2026 night fell. As we lay in our tent talking by the light of flashlights, we both heard the very loud snap of deadfall in the woods behind the tent. We sat up, frozen and listening. We heard what sounded like a very large and heavy person, slowly walking around our site, making no effort to conceal his presence, judging from the loud sound of breaking sticks and brush. We were both scared believing that someone was out there. We exited the tent, Craig with a shotgun and me with the M-1. I started yelling very loud. \\\"Hey! We know you are there. We have guns and will shoot!\\\" Again, we heard the sound of someone walking slowly but methodically around from our left to right. We shinned our lights in the direction but could not see anything but the trees and brush. We talked amongst ourselves, wondering if it could be a bear or something, but we decided that it was a person and not an animal. After much yelling and warning that we would shoot, I decided to fire a few rounds in the direction of the noise (how crazy that sounds now) and I did just that. I fired about three rounds into the trees and the sound was unbelievable. The weapon blasted and the sound echoed into the night, roaring into the canyons and fading off into the night air. We stood in silence. To our utter disbelief and eventual horror whatever it was, began to move again, still left to right, in a circle around us. What we both thought and discussed later, was that NO animal would have stuck around after the horrific noise of the M-1. Most normal people would not have stuck around either! Whoever or whatever was out there not only stuck around, but appeared, from the casual sound of the slow walking, to be less than concerned about our weapons. We made a decision to vacate the area post haste! Grabbing our coats, we climbed the embankment up to the dirt road, and carrying our weapons, we ran the entire way, about three miles more or less, back to the main highway, San Francisquito Canyon Rd. We spent a very long night, curled up in a concrete drainage ditch, waiting for the sun to rise. Every hour or so, a lone truck would come by and the sound of that brought us comfort. Again, it was a long night! The next day, we hiked back to the site, expecting to find our tent and all of our supplies missing. To our surprise, everything was as we had left it. Nothing was out of place. We gathered our things, and hiked back to the open area of the old campground. We decided not to sleep in the tent because it limited our vision, and instead, laid our sleeping bags out in an open area, above the creek. After a day of climbing cliffs and cooking and such, night fell again. That night, just as the sun set and darkness was beginning to fall, Craig and I were walking in the direction of the main road. We were looking for rattle snakes, because we had shot one earlier on the dirt road in the same area. As we walked side by side with me on the left, both holding weapons, we saw it. Standing just on the dirt road, facing us was a Bigfoot. There can be NO DOUBT at all about what it was. We could see it very clearly. He was about eight or nine feet tall and stood with his left shoulder even with the edge of the trail. He was covered with dark hair and had long arms. We did NOT smell anything unusual, as I have since read about other sightings. The strange thing about him was the absolute indifference in his expression. He did not look threatening. He did not look scared. He just stood there looking at us\\u2026.almost bored. I instinctively brought my right hand up against Craig's chest and we both stopped dead in our tracks. We never took our eyes off of the Bigfoot as we spoke. I said, \\\"Do you see that? Are we seeing this?\\\" Craig said, \\u201cWhat do we do\\u201d? \\u201cWhat should we do?\\\" We both started to walk backwards as we spoke, very slowly and involuntarily. The Bigfoot just looked at us for a few moments. Then, and I will NEVER forget the detail of this\\u2026\\u2026 he just slowly and very casually turned to his left, and began to walk into the forest. When he did that, Craig and I stopped and started talking over each other. \\\"Do we shoot it? Should we shoot it? What do we do? Do you want to follow it?\\\" As we talked, we heard a sound that we both immediately recognized from the prior night, the sound of the Bigfoot slowly walking deeper into the woods, breaking deadfall, twigs and branches as he went. We never did fire a shot or follow him. We stayed up late and slept in shifts at the campground and did not hear from the Bigfoot again. The next day, Tom came up with food and supplies. We ran to him and told him the details of what had happened. It was very clear by his expression that he did not believe us. We took him to the exact spot where we saw the Bigfoot and we discovered a trail of giant footprints leading from the trail into the woods. Tom smiled and told us that we did a good job making them. We were so frustrated and begged Tom to follow the tracks with us. We all followed them and they went into and across the creek. On the other side, we found a large red ant hill with a footprint right on top of it. I asked Tom, how could we have done that? He just shook his head and smiled. We followed the tracks to a point where two large hills formed a valley that sloped upwards into the mountain area. The ground turned rocky and the prints stopped. That is what happened. I have lived with this memory for many years. I am now Forty Five years old and am less concerned about what people think of me in terms of this incident. It is a fact and because of it, I know for sure that Bigfoot lives or at least once lived in the area of Green Valley California.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Green Valley\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"San Francisquito Canyon Rd.\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Pine forest in the high desert area of Southern California.

There were 4 of us hunting that day; my dad, and myself and 2 good buddies. Well, the deer hunting was not that good that day so one of my buddies said to us, my wife's uncle is gone from his cabin and won't be back any time soon, so why don't we visit his land and all and just hang out and all and have some lunch. Well, he lives by Lake Hughes's road and close to where we were. We went over there and unlocked the gate as he had a key. We went in there and we had brought some apples for our lunch and all. We seen he had hogs and started feeding them these apples. After about 1/2 hour of doing this, we heard the horses behind the house or cabin, running around and making all kinds of noise. We could not see what was going on as; the house was in the way. But, man were they going nuts!!!  So, we all said to each other, let's get over there and see what's up. We did and could not see anything but the horses still going nuts and running in circles. We then looked over this fence and threw a gate and seen these huge foot print's and smelled something like a dog that's been wet and rotten egg's mixed. Well, the gate was locked and he went inside the cabin or house and got a key for the gate. We went over to the prints, and I'm 6-5 at that time, and weighed 275 lbs. I have a shoe size of 15 4-E. These tracks were much bigger than my shoe and they were made, with some of them in the snow.  I stepped next to them and could not press down and going that deep! I could go maybe 3/4 - 1 inch down. These prints were 4 inches deep!! They were also, 2 to3 inches longer than my foot and much wider. Then I tried to step that far with my step, and no way could I. Then we followed the tracks until they came to this really steep hill. There this thing went up this hill on 2 legs and stepped high enough that, even my good buddy who was a body builder and in great shape, could not climb. I could not even lift my leg that far, and I was 16 years old and pretty limber. No man could lift there leg that high or step that far! No man!!!  Nowhere did we see bear tracks and even if we did, they don't walk that far on 2 legs. Whatever this was, it walked along this fence and turned and went back into the woods, and then up this very steep hill. It must have looked at the horses and maybe seen us feeding the hogs.

Nobody could change my mind on this one as, I know what I seen and it was not set up as, nobody knew we were going to his ranch, and the next ranch over, nobody was home there either.

I worked at the Gladstone mine North of Silverton Colorado and lived in Montrose Colorado. I usually car pooled with another individual at the time and we took turns rotating driving every other day I.E. we took my truck one day and his the next. We did this four days each week for two weeks on day shift and two weeks on swing shift. Anyway to get to the story and sum it up. I  ended up driving to work by myself that particular day because my car pool did not show up in time making me a little late or behind our normal time of leaving.  Whoever was driving in the morning had to be alert and wide awake because of all of the deer and elk along the road and crossing the road that early in the morning. The commute south on 550 from Montrose to the mine took about one and half hours which is about seven miles north and west of Silverton CO. I had just come over Red mountian pass going south bound on 550 and just south of the Ophir Pass 4 wheel rd turn off about two miles and north of the east turning curve towards Silverton about one and half miles. As I was approaching what is known as the slide area I was on a relative short stretch of straight away and approching some S curves now at the time you could see across these S curves to the other side in which the road on the other side is in line with the first straight away and continues for a short way before a slight curve to the left that starts downhill. I had my head lights set slightly higher and wide, then stock on that 1985 Toyota 4x4 with rectangle Halogen headlights so that my truck would have a better chance of stopping or avoiding any collisions with a deer or an elk. DID I HAVE ADIQUATE LIGHTING? YES. Anyway as I am on the first straight away I could clearly see across to the second straight away when I saw movement up on this high embankment to the left on the second straight away about fifty feet above the highway and moving down the almost eighty foot tall and almost vertical embankment. What i saw was not clear until it came directly into the path of my head lights which were on bright by then. It was standing upright and took about four steps from the embankment to the other side of the 2 lane highway and paused slightly in front of a 12 foot or taller big yellow diamond shaped sign that warns of the slide area ahead. it appeared that this creature was slightly blinded or confused by my head lights and paused with two small quick shuffeling steps and a slight glance in my direction before it dropped over the steep embankment on the west or right side of the highway. when that thing stood in front of the yellow sign on that white post at first I thought it was a huge bear and then relized that bears do not travel around on 2 legs and 10 to 11 foot tall bears are not in exsistence in that area. I saw the glare of its eyes at least three times. It walked upright the whole time. Because of its height, gait and posture, slightly slouched forward above mid back,  and its dark multi coloring I always believed that I saw a bigfoot. I tried to confide to a couple of friends what I had seen later that morning at work but I was met with a skeptical attitude. Therefore I began to keep it to myself and only have discussed it with close people and still have met resistance in talking about it. The time of day was early morning about 5:30 in the morning, dark and little or no moon. The weather was clear and tempurature mid 30 degrees. I did slow down at the crossing site and looked over the west side of the road as best I could briefly but hurried off in fear. After work I drove back by the crossing site and stopped. I noticed 5 or 6 large indentations, all in a row coming down the east embankment. It is very steep, with gray shale and dirt. The trail was at a slight angle at about 5 oclock.  These appeared to be heel marks like a human would leave descending a very steep slope but much much larger, disturbing the earth around them in a downward sliding motion around each track. I was and still am an avid rifle and archery hunter as well as an experienced tracker and outdoorsman and have hunted and camped excessivly in south western Colorado and the san juan mountains. To me it would be a great relief to have it proven to the world that these creatures exist and should and could be studied with great restraint so as not to disturb them too much.

      "{\"REPORT_NUMBER\": \"1372\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"low cloud cover, good light, unlimited visibly\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class A\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": null, \"STATE\": \"Colorado\", \"OBSERVED\": \"After an unsuccessful days elk hunting trek of many miles around the heavy timbered area near the Rabbit Ears pass region, my Uncle Bill, Cousin Charles and myself, decided to call it a day and head back to our camp in the Walton Creek Campgrounds. About four miles south of our camp, as we were talking softly together while we walked, a loud crashing noise behind us came to our attention. My Uncle, an experienced hunter and woodsman of many years, replied that it sounded like we had spooked a large bull elk. Having accustomed ourselves to the area over the last few days, we knew that a deep canyon running through that location about 3 hundred yards in the direction the animal was moving would slow it down. Thinking that we could possibly get a fair shot as it crossed this canyon below us, the three of us started in pursuit. The animal was obviously spooked and running, as the sounds of its progress through the dense aspen trees and pines ahead, were easy to hear. After a laborious and exhausted chase through the heavy timber, the three of us broke out upon the canyons edge expecting to see the \\\"Bull Elk\\\" crossing the canyon bottom below us. The canyon in mention, runs in a south westerly direction, dry bottomed and is sparsely treed do to its steep sides. It is approx. a hundred yards deep, narrow sided, approx. 50 yards across the bottoms, with a heavy foliage of brush averaging 3 to 4 feet high. Trying to catch our breath, we were amazed that no elk was in sight below us running across the bottoms. After a few seconds I was alerted to the sound of rolling rocks across the canyon from me. As I looked up horizontally and directly across the canyon from me, I spotted what I at first believed to be a very large Black Bear running up the steep sided canyon. The opposite canyon rim was slightly higher than the side upon which we stood. The distance was approximately 200 yards. Startled, I called out to my companions attention the animals location, raising my rifle to view the animal through my rifle scope. After losing a second or two while I located the animal in my scope I was stunned. The creature was running up the steep hill on two feet. It was cover completely with what appeared to be matted, shaggy course black hair. The full back, shoulders, buttocks and legs were turned to me. The back of the head appeared to be hunched slightly foreword and without apparent neck visible. The back of the head was round skulled with no dome shape visible. Through the scope, I did not see the arms or hands, as they were directly in front of the creature and blocked from my view by its body. After later reflection, I believe the creature was using brush and limbs in its path to help pull itself up the incline. After approx. ten seconds the animal reached the top of the opposite canyon. Without pausing, I saw the creature turn slightly at the hips, presenting its right shoulder to me and peer sideways across at us as it disappeared through the trees. I clearly observed the facial features through the scope. The face was flat, small mouthed and thinned liped. The nose was flat with large nostril flares. The eyes appeared to be intelligent, what I would call a knowing look, black, slightly wide apart and set below a low brow ridge. The face seemed to be lighter in color, possibly tan or light brown and hairless with a leathery appearance. The sighting was of approx. ten seconds or less. After a moment of startled silence, the three of us compared notes about what we saw and discussed our options about what to do. All three us immediately decided against trying to follow it. One: It was late in the day and its trail ran in a direction away from our camp. Two: Even though all three of us were armed with high caliber rifles, none of us believed that we wanted to get too close to the animal. Three: As all three of us were experienced hunters, we knew that we could not shoot what ever it was in any case, as it was too close in resemblance to a human and we did not kill anything unless it was for food. However, we were excited about seeing a creature that none of us had ever seen before and decided to back track it towards our camp area in order to get a better idea about what we had seen. As the creatures trail was very easy to find due to torn brush and tree limbs in its passage, we followed it for about 3 miles to where it emerged out of the forest, crossing US Highway 40, where it continued back into the forest on the other side. Due to the lateness of the day and exhaustion we abandoned the trail and returned via the highway back to camp. Observations: It was apparent that we had startled the animal about 350 yards north of the canyon where we had skirted a wide patch of brush. We had passed within a few yards from this creature as our own tracks were clearly visible. After examining the area closely the following day it became obvious that animal had been taking its time wandering around through the thicket foraging for service berries, acorns from the scrub oak and wild currents. We believed the animal had become aware of our approach and had lain down in the brush waiting for us to pass, then in a state of panic had fled the area in great haste. All along the creatures path form this thicket to the canyon, brush and large tree branches had been disrupted by a great deal of mass and force. Judging from 3 to 4 inch thick tree limbs 7 to 8 feet above the ground, the creature stood apprx. 71/2 to 8 feet tall, which coincided with our judgment at the time of the sighting. The ground through out the area was covered in fall leaves and pine needles or else frozen and rock covered, leaving a poor surface for track impressions. However in several wash out areas the creature hand left a few clear enough scattered tracks for us to get a measurement. For the most part the animal appeared to have traveled in a wandering action, leaving tracks of 15 3/4 inches. From one impression it was discovered that the creature was missing the little toe from its left foot. It was judged by my uncle, an experienced game tracker of 40 years, that the creature had weighed upwards of 350 pounds. Once the creature had taken flight, it had traveled rapidly with over 7 foot strides, oblivious to obstructions, crashing directly through brush and trees. At one point the creature had hurtled a fallen tree about four feet off the ground, apparently without braking stride, leaving a deep impression in the torn soil upon landing on the other side. No hair strands or scat signs were found. Conclusion: The following day a report was made to a Colorado State and Game officer checking hunters in the area for licensees and game kills. The officer seemed skeptical at most and unwilling to check out the physical evidence. In his professional opinion it was only a bear and possibly a combination of hunting nerves. He also warned us about the use of alcohol while accompanied by fire arms. Needless to say we were offended by the way the report was received and by the accompanied remarks. In the final analysis the three witnesses concluded: A. The animal had definitely not been a bear or any other animal that they were familiar with. B. The creature stood approx. 71/2 to 8 feet tall and weighed in at approx. 350 pounds. C. The creature had been bipedal.\", \"COUNTY\": \"Routt County\", \"DATE\": \"15\", \"MONTH\": \"October\", \"YEAR\": \"1970\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"4 miles SW of Walton Creek Campgrounds, Routt National Forest, Gore Mtn.

My father killed an elk and asked if I could meet him one morning to dress it and haul it down a steep slide.  The slide is an open area that extends up the side of a mountain about 1/2 mile.  It is steep and as a result has a central corridor that is devoid of trees.  It is surrounded on both sides by dense forest growth.  It is rocky and very rugged. I met him one morning at about 1030 am to help out.  When I arrived he told me he had heard a series of very loud knocks sometime before I arrived.  He said it was up the slide toward the rim and the flat tops area on the top of the mountain.  He said that they were very loud and sounded like a man hammering on a tree with a hammer.  He said that the knocks were so unusual, he thought I was up above him messing around with him.  I told him that I had not been, and then jokingly commented that bigfoots are   said to make sounds like that. Anyway, we started working on the elk and I was there about a 1/2 hour when we heard the knocks again.  This time, they were to our left (south), at the same elevation on the moutain we were on.

At just before midnight, on a dark stretch of Interstate 25, heading North towards Denver (just 100 some miles before Colorado Springs,CO.) something strange caught my eye. I was seated in the passenger side of the car. A friend, Trent, was driving. In the backseat, asleep and extremely ill, was another friend. To the right, traveling at 60 MPH, the headlights caught what appeared to be a 3-4 foot, white haired ape-like creature, with a dark face. It was standing upright. My eyes caught it some 100 feet ahead in the lights, and I followed it with my eyes. It was merely standing there at the side of the road. Although I admit a childhood interest in BIGFOOT lore, I almost instantly dismissed it as such a creature. Surely my eyes were playing tricks on me. I said nothing to my friend, who was driving. My first instinct was to ask my friend to turn around and go back to investigate. Instead, I said nothing. Five minutes later, my friend pulled off to the side of the road, as he had to \\\"relieve\\\" himself. We met at the back of the car to \\\"take care of business\\\", where he expressed he was getting tired. I agreed, telling him, I, too, was tired, and was starting to \\\"see things\\\". He then told me, that he was also \\\"seeing things\\\", saying, \\\"Yeah, I just thought I saw a Polar Bear back there.\\\" A chill went up my spine, and I asked him if it was \\\"white and furry\\\". He said yes. I told him that I thought I saw a \\\"small white ape, with a dark face!\\\" Without missing a beat, he told me to get in the car. \\\"Let's get out of here!\\\" We wanted to go back to investigate, but our sick friend in the backseat needed to get home, due to his illness.

I wondered if they may have been human, and had enlarged and spread out by the heating, melting, cooling and refreezing that occurs at that time of year in the little snow patches. But the detail was fairly preserved and one would think that any melting and refreezing would blur those details. The possibility of this phenomenon should be examined. Someone should walk through the summer snow patches barefooted and then observe the prints for a number of days during the summer when this melt/refreeze procees occurs. If the enlarging of the prints and spreading of the stride does not occur, I assume these prints I saw were not human. If they do spread out, maybe someone just walked through there barefooted. I wondered if it were a hoax, but the area was quite remote and the perpetrator would have to know someone would pass that exact spot. I don't recall if we were on an established trail or just wandering near our campsite. Also if it was a hoax, why would they put the prints in the snow, since one could not predict exactly when it would melt in the unpredictable summer weather. I have no particular interest in the existence of the Sasquatch, but as a scientist I am curious. Having seen these prints with my own eyes, I definitely believe it is possible. There were two friends were with me and we all saw the same thing.

While living there I was involved in several related situations. One of my foster sons was employed for a time with the U.S. Forest Service working in the sign maintainence shop.  They had quite a rash of Forest Service signs being ripped down.  If you are familiar with the signs they use they are constructed of massive timbers and quite sturdy.  Some of the signs were over 8 foot off the ground to the top yet they had been torn down with apparent ease.  At first they suspected local teenagers or possibly bears as being responsible.  To make it more difficult for the vandals the Forest Service put a thick layer of grease along the tops of some of the signs.  Within days, one of the signs was again vandalized.  The grease on the top of the damaged sign show a huge human like handprint. A few weeks later we decided to go on a late night cruise in the area where the damage had taken place - just a mile or two below Turquoise Lake west of Leadville.  The dirt road we followed had a steep drop off to a stream on the left.  To the right was a large open sagebrush meadow with thick timber behind.  A large boulder, at least 15 feet tall, was in the middle of the meadow.  We had stopped on the road above the stream and were visiting when we heard something \\\"sloshing\\\" in the water below our vehicle.  When we trained a spotlight on the area, the sloshing stopped, only to start again when the light was turned off.  A few minutes later we spotted a large figure run across the road about 100 yards in front of our headlights.  We also heard heavy footsteps crushing the sagebrush.  We immediately drove to the spot where we had seen the creature and checked for footprints.  Non were found but a trail of mashed sagebrush lead towards the treeline.  We swung the spotlight around the area just in time to catch a glimpse of a dark primate, about 7 - 8 feet tall, cross in front of the aforementioned boulder and disappear into the dense forest behind the meadow. I don\\u2019t remember any particulars but believe the incidents occurred during the summer of 1975 (probably July or August) and time was sometime around 10 pm.\", \"SEASON\": \"Summer\"},\n",

I was not particularly worried, because the animal was rapidly moving in the opposite direction I was headed.

No one else was in the area.  I immediately presumed this animal was a black bear.

I scanned in the direction I thought it originated from but it's hard to tell in the mountains because of echo. I looked to the right first into the forest and saw nothing, then slowly did a 360 scan and now I'm looking back to the forest. At 50 yards I spot the bigfoot.

The area was heavily forested and had plenty of water. The expedition was well planned and was executed well. The majority of the participants arrived at the initial base camp location on 8 Sept and individual camps (groups of two-three) were positioned along the drainage. We had all been briefed on the history of sightings, tracks, and vocalizations in the area,  and the methods we'd use to determine their presence. We spread out that evening, stayed in touch via walkie talkie, and conducted wood knocking and calling in an coordinated manner. We had night vision devices, recording devices, and IR detection equipment.  We worked well into the early morning hours (2 AM). Nothing was heard.  The next morning (9 Sept) the guides said we should move the base camp to another target area, because we would have heard any sasquatches the night before if they were in that drainage. We drove a few hours to a new location across the Continental Divide. The night of 9 Sept was spent in canyon near the new base camp.  Participants were positioned a half mile to quarter mile intervals (I think) with the sound blaster positioned in the middle of the group. The calls and wood knocks announced and timed so as not to be confused with a response. Nothing was heard. The next day (10 Sept.), the focus moved to a different canyon, near where some possible vocalizations were heard the night before by one of the guides. A group of five or six worked the top of the drainage from well above the timber line and hiked down in the direction of the base camp.  Two others worked the road on ATVs above the valley, and a few others worked the hillsides above the drainage. I hiked up the same drainage starting from the base camp. As I was walking up the trail next to the creek, about a mile or so from camp, I was in radio contact with the group above me. We would announce when we would call or wood knock. We could hear the knocks and calls between us, but just barely. I proceeded to a fork in the trail and found an old hunting camp site that had been used in previous years but had shown no signs of recent use.  I started to take an old trail that went through the camp site when I heard two distinct and clear wood knocks to my left approximately 150 - 200 yards away at most \\u2013 close enough to startle me significantly as I was by my self. I stopped and immediately got on the radio \\u2013 no one was within a mile of two of me and no one had said they were knocking.  The sound was much closer and more distinct that those made by the guys way up on the ridge above me. After about two minutes, I picked up a large stick and made two or three loud wood knocks in reply.  I got an immediate response of two knocks that appeared to be a little farther away (maybe 300-400 yards) but still very clear.  The knocks were similar to the first I had heard but just a little farther away. I responded again with knocks and then a whoop or two over a 30 minute period but got no additional replies.  I was alert to any movement or smells in the area but noticed none. Eventually I decided to return to base camp.  After arriving at camp I linked up with a few other guys. We road ATVs to the location where I heard the knocks to investigate further.  One guy took the ATV further on the trail that forked to the left at the old camp site. He went for about .7 miles in the direction where the sound came from. He later said he noticed a musty smell in that area.  The group that worked the drainage from the top had found a couple of sets of tracks (which they photographed). I saw the pictures and thought they were pretty clear. As they moved down the valley they also noticed a distinct smell about 500 yards to the left of the above referenced wood knock incident. This is the same area where Lee picked up the smell and turned around on the trail. Some things happened later that night around the base camp. I'll let the others describe those incidents.  I recommend that as a prerequisite for attending expeditions, each attendee should listen closely to the Sierra Sounds CD.  I bought it after the trip and wish I had heard it before the trip. It gives a good understanding of what they sound like, the wood knocks, the vocalizations, and all.  The expedition guides from the BFRO were very informative and helpful. They brought a lot of experience to the event. The guides from Colorado had extensive knowledge of the encounters in this area, including some of their own. Other attendees were witnesses from Colorado. I hope to work with the Colorado guides and the other newbies over the next year (may even be up for a trip to Wyoming). I now have a working sound blaster, and a couple of digital trail cams \\u2013 enough to be dangerous.  I hope to attend some of the other expeditions over the next year (Oklahoma, Arizona or Oregon) and work with this group again. My wife thinks I have lost it.

We took a break and my son, Dallas C, was scanning a mountain to the west of us with his binoculars when he saw it.  My daughter-in-law grabbed the binoculars and looked, and she said, \\\" It's chasing some deer,\\\" then, \\\"My God, Mom, it's got knees!\\\"  She said it ran into a group of pine trees.  I got my binoculars and we stood quietly and waited.  Several minutes later it leaped out from the trees and went running across the face of the mountain.  I swear, that thing could run like the wind, and this was rugged terrain, but it had a very strange, destinctive gait.  The friend that was with us saw it without binoculars.  I guarantee you it was not a fake.  There is absolutely no possibility that it could have been.  No human could run that fast,  especially across that rugged mountain, and it was at least seven feet tall.  What is puzzling is that it didn't seem to fit with things I have read about them.  This one was pitch black, not redish brown, and it was seen in bright daylight in the middle of the day.  It was chasing deer, which I think would rule out it being a vegetarian.  Another thing I thought really interesting was that a huge bird, maybe a vulture of some kind kept circling around where the thing was, like maybe it was waiting for it to make a kill.  My son insisted that it had a tuft of snow white hair on its head.  We didn't report this sighting because we didn't think anybody would believe us, plus, we didn't want some gun-happy nuts trying to hunt it down.

I did not go look for prints after the 2:30 am visual, as it was snowing heavily and quite cold outside, and the presence of the figure crossing the yard in back of me, passing by the back-lighted basement of the large, 2-story family reunion home, startled me considerably.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"None that I am aware of.\", \"STATE\": \"Colorado\", \"OBSERVED\": \"Visual Incident: I was spending the evening at a 2 bedroom cabin at the YMCA in Estes Park. It had been a cold, snowy day, and I had gone to bed rather early (around 8 pm.). I awakened at 2:30 and got up to look out the bedroom window, through the curtains, just to check on the weather, see if stars were out, etc. I noticed that the basement lights were still on in the rather large, two-story 3-bedroom family cabin. This cabin was about 75 yards directly SE of my cabin (in back of me). I assumed the lights were still on since children may have been playing games that night, and simply forgot to turn out the lights. I looked out the window of about a half minute with this thought on my mind. I didn't see any movement inside the cabin basement, so I assumed the family had retired for the evening. Just as I was about to close the curtain, I saw a very tall, rather large, dark figure stride past the entirely of the basement, across the snow. The stride of this figure was very deliberate and determined. It did not waiver. It did not rush. The figure had long legs, and was mostly all legs. Its torso was solid and straight. It did not look human, I did not discern any clothing on it. I was puzzled at first, thinking, \\\"Who in their right mind would be outside in this weather, walking in the deep snow (about 1/2 foot or so deep) outside past the lighted basement of this cabin? The figure emerged from the right side of the cabin and was heading to the left side, which would have been toward the direction of the road and the next set of cabins (about 50 or more yards away). There were no other lights on at the time, but the snow held its own illumination in the dark. The basement back-lighting created the perfect silhouette for the striding figure. I only saw it swing its arms, it was not carrying anything. After I watched it pass, I closed the curtain (this episode lasted about 20-30 seconds) and then it occurred to me it had resembled images of what I have been informed about regarding sightings of Bigfoot. i did not have Bigfoot on my mind AT ALL prior to this incident. The image remained in my mind for a good while, so I got up and checked all the locks on the doors, just to feel more safe, since I was staying alone in the cabin. Auditory (Vocalization episode) The next day was especially snowy, almost like a white out. The snow was VERY thick and it was easy to get stuck, as the YMCA plows were working as hard and fast as they could to clear the narrow roads throughout the campus. It was very difficult to pass safely down some of the roads. I had just come out of the Mootz Crafts Center, and had gotten my car stuck. I was fortunate that some kind male guests spotted me getting stuck and helped to push my car out of a snow bank. They left quickly and went back inside the lodge nearby. The snow was falling quickly and heavily, and I was beginning to worry I might get stuck again. I was standing outside my car, trying to determine the best driving route to take, when all of a sudden from the back of the woods, nearby what I would determine was the Livery Stables, came a very loudly projected guttural (like from the deep part of the back of a throat) type of cry-moan. It lasted several seconds (about 4 seconds or so). I looked around to see if I could see anyone, but no one was out at all. The weather was far too severe. I stood by my car, opened the car-door, which made a squeak, and the sound uttered once again, almost exactly as it had the first time. Same loudly projected quality, carrying from somewhere back deep in the nearby woods. This time, I felt intimated and frightened. This sound did not match the sound of an elk, or a mountain lion or a person, or a kid being silly. \\\"The bears are all asleep,\\\" I thought. The message that I perceived from it was \\\"I am here. I can see you. This is my territory.\\\" I quickly got into my car, closed the door and managed to pull away out of the deep snow, leaving the YMCA campus. it was a very eerie experience,and I can still feel the chill going up my spine as I think of the impact of those howls on that very snowy day.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Estes Park CO\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Hwy 36/34\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"The visual incident occurred on the SE side of the campus, not far from Mesa Drive, Reunion Lane and Snugglers Cove.

At night we all played games like glow in the dark dodgeball or went inside the cafeteria to play telephone or mystery date. Sometimes before bed we would go out and watch the bats dive bomb small rocks we tossed up into the air under the light above the back door. Another game we played at night up there is called \\\"Mission Impossible.\\\" The idea is that a camp counselor goes into the surrounding woods whitch are cordoned off and hides as best he can. Everyone else (kids and group leaders) goes to find this person so he can give you a slip that says you found him. If you are one of the first five back you get ice cream or cake, some prize of that sort. Meanwhile the other counselors are out with flashlights patrolling around looking for you. If you are spotted you have to go back to the cafeteria and start over. While I was out looking for the counselor I was hidden in the bushes next to the road leading to the cafeteria. Behind me was the baseball field. It was illuminated by a bright moon out that night. I had ducked into the bushes because two of the counselors who were searching walked right passed me. As I was crouched into the thick of the bushes I was motionless listening for anything that would tip me off to the whereabouts of anyone else. Thats when it struck me I couldent hear any of the regular sounds from the woods. No chirps, no animal rustling, none of the natural sounds I was used to hearing out there night after night. As I started looking around I heard a light shaking of bushes adjacent to me in the baseball sidelines. I'm crouched about 5 feet from first base and the bushes were moving over by third base. As I watched figuring I would see one of the counselors or another searcher come out of the bushes, something else did. It was huge. Myself, I am 6'4\\\" and leveled off this thing as it came out next to the fence whitch was 4 ft high. The fence came up to what I can only guess was its waist witch  I figure would put it about 8' to 8'5\\\" tall, gigantic shoulders and a thin waist like you would expect on a bodybuilder. I was dumbfounded and shocked, but not scared as it didnt seem to know where I was or that I was even there. It stepped out cautiously and took a few steps into the open to cross toward the outfield. About two steps into the field it crouched down and looked toward the road as a couple kids who got caught came around the bend and walked by me with thier backs to the baseball field. Then as they got farther away I looked back and it was on two feet and was moving in a flash. It was across the field in about 5-6 second and into the woods alongside the mountain. When it ran I could see its whipsy hair in the moonlight, but I couldent make out a color. After It left I emerged from the bushes and spent the last of the evening in the cafeteria. My mother who was a counselor said I must have been cold because I was white as a sheet. This was not a bear, deer, or elk.

They were staying in a Log Cabin with one of the family members, and had spent the first few days of thier trip walking the outlying forestry, and going to old mining sites and other places of interest. On the fourth day, they all decided to spend an evening out with a barbeque and invited over a few friends from a travelling show that they know from Iowa. At dusk, my aunt said that two of the travellers (J & S) returned to the barbecue, after hiking up a small valley for about 5 miles. Both were visibly shaken and upset. They told everyone that they had been followed by something at a distance of 30 ft or so for the past few hours, it smelled similar to old, damp caravan interiors and when J had shouted towards the creature, it seemed to back off slightly before violently shaking foliage. This is when they both panicked - as J could see 'fur' as the creature moved, and thought it could've been a bear. My aunt requested that everyone leave just in case the 'bear' had followed J & S back to camp, but due to inebriation most of the group were laughing, and didn't take the story too seriously. At about 10:00pm, a fire was lit, and some of the travellers started juggling firesticks or playing thier instruments. My aunt thinks this may have been a lure, as over the festivities they heard a very loud, very high pitched scream just off the small clearing. One of the more drunken members of the group started walking and shouting towards where the vocalization had eminated - he later stated that he was 'trying to communicate' - when a few of the people at close range saw what was described as 'a very tall, very powerful ape-like creature' moving at first into the clearing, and then away from the camp at great speed. It had long beige hair, approx 6\\\" long, and a dark area around the face and elbows.

The tracks were about 12 to 13 inches long with only four toes that I could see and a broad arch and heel area. I returned to camp and brought the camp cook back to look at them since they crossed the creek only about 100 yards from our tents. I decided to follow the tracks and found where the creature had stood on the other side of the creek milling about as if trying to decide where to go. The tracks led uphill through the black timber, which I followed for about half an hour.  The tracks had begun to interest my horse a great deal.  He kept sniffing the tracks and became more and more skittish until, in an area of several big blow-downs, he refused to go any further and began to show signs of panic which of course was transmitted to me.  I took a hard left into a big avalanche area which I followed for about 300 or 400 yards.  The black timber which I had just left began to turn into Aspens so I cut back hoping to reacquire the track.

She says it happened when she was young, back in the late 60s, maybe early 70s, I would guess.  I will confirm this with her. My family used to have a cabin near and North of Dillon, Colorado off of Highway 9.  There is a \\\"Blue River Campground\\\" there.  The private road we would take to the cabin is directly across Hwy 9 from the entrance to this campground.  My uncle and aunt, 20 years older than my mom, bought this cabin back in the 60s, they had it until around 1990, when I was 10, so I have been to the locations described in this report.  My mom was in her teens when this happened.  I am not, however, familiar with how the land is currently being used, as I have not been there since the cabin was sold.  I doubt the cabin is even there anymore, it did not have electric or water service.  Only a Propane stove with about a 60 gallon propane drum and an outhouse.  Rural extremist-cabins have taken hold in the area surrounding Dillon, CO since the early 90s and many large-scale cabins have been erected in that area, so I don't know if that area is still private or not. This road led into a privately owned cattle ranch, there was a gate we needed to open & close as we went through, so traffic and any other people were very infrequent when I was a kid.  It was probably even more so at the time of the incident my mother has told me about. Once at the cabin, you could head up an old logging-road turned to trail, up the mountain kind of following the runoff creek & find a beaver dam/pond about 3/4 to 1 mile up the trail.  We would fish here & catch many little rainbow trout.  Farther up the trail/mountain was another beaver pond, I would guess maybe an additional 1/2-1 mile up the trail. When I was 10 and under, I would often walk and explore these woods alone.  I always thought this story my mom told me was just to scare me into staying close to the cabin.  I would often wander But, now, we no longer own the cabin and I am 26; she claims this story was always true. The technical owners of this cabin, my aunt and uncle had a son, my cousin, that was very close to my mom's age.  They would spend a lot of time at the cabin in his and my mom's younger years with the family.  My cousin had a small dirt bike, that he and my mom would ride tandem on through the forest there. She said when they were young, they had taken a ride up the trail together on the dirt bike, my cousin driving and my mom riding on the seat behind him.  She said it was a tight fit, and she would almost fall off.  They passed the first beaver pond and continued up the trail to the 2nd.  When you approach the 2nd beaver pond, the trail rises up this hill and the beaver pond is located kind of on a plateau of land.  So, you come up over the burm from the trail and reach the plateau where you can see the entire beaver pond, it was only about 50-75 feet across, and the edge of the pond was surrounded by a fairly good amount of open land, when I would go there, I remember about 10-30 feet of grass between the pond and the trees.  It seems the beavers built the pond in what was a creek going through a meadow and it filled up most of the meadow. She said as they approached the burm leading up to the plateau, my cousin saw it first.  He whipped the dirt bike around to head back down the hill, saying some explitives about what he just saw.  My mom, being in the back did not see it until the bike spun around and she slid off the back onto her feet.  There was a large, very large, white creature squatting down on the edge of the pond, with its knees on either side of its body, reaching down into the water.  It was covered in 5-7\\\" white furr.  Its body was bulky and muscular.  Obviously not a bear, as only black bears and the rare grizzly bear are located in this area.  There are no creatures covered fully in white furr.  My family, being a \\\"redneck-type\\\" of family, are full of hunters, campers and hikers.  We all know what a white-tailed deer, Elk, Bears, Mountain Lion, Porkupine, Bobcats, etc...look like.  She said this thing must have weighed at least 700-800 lbs.  Because it was squatting down, height could not be estimated accurately. By the time my mom saw it, my cousin was already beginning to go as quickly as he could back down the trail.  She took a quick couple of seconds glance at this creature.  I need to verify if she noticed it react in any way and how far away from it they were when they saw it.  They headed quickly down the trail terrified as she tried to stay on the seat, but mostly slid off and was halfway riding and running behind the dirt bike trying to keep up. As a kid, I was told many stories of these mostly aspen covered woods.  Most were just campfire tales to scare us, but this one was for real.  Even 20-30 years later as I was a boy exploring those woods...after I heard this story, I never went farther than the first beaver pond because I was always creeped out because of this tale.  From time to time, I remember feeling like something was watching me.  Not always, but sometimes.  Thinking back on it now, I think I must have been crazy to wander around those woods alone being under 10 years old.  I read this site and the reports in the 60's & 70's in Colorado.  I saw other posts of reports of a creature with white fur.  This prompted me to post this story my mom told me.  Perhaps it was still in those woods when I was a boy, or perhaps its relatives or offspring.  Perhaps one of these things are what I felt watching me from time to time.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Dillon\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"HWY 9\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"dry mountainous beaver pond surrounded in a dense aspen tree forest with occasional patches of pine trees\", \"COUNTY\": \"Summit County\", \"SEASON\": \"Summer\", \"YEAR\": \"late 60s\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"Provided in story.\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"This would have been either in the morning, or during the day, but it was in full light.\"},\n",

While hiking on the trail we had encountered a larger then normal amount of snow due to the late snow storms.  We were a few miles up the trail from Surprise Lake when we heard a low growl.  We thought this must be a mountain lion and due to the snow and inability to travel quickly we double backed to surprise lake and set up camp for the night.  While sitting at the lakeside I saw a large, brownish red animal across the lake.  The animal was large and appeared to be walking upright.  My rational mind said its just a deer or another large animal that lives in the wilderness and disregarded what I thought I saw.  Later that evening around dusk my husband and I were sitting in the tent when we heard what sounded like a knock against a tree.  We looked out the tent door and didn't see anything.  Again I assumed this must have been a woodpecker, another animal, or a hiker.  We continued talking and heard the knock again, it was a three knock pattern, along with something that sounded like a rock against a tree.  We got out of the tent and looked around.  I told my husband it sounded like a rock thrown against a tree and said let me show you what it sounds like.  I picked up a hard sound rock and threw it against the tree.  Immediately a similar sound came back.  I assumed it was an echo and I did it again.  Again a similar sound came back.  My husband then asked if I saw something moving up the hillside and explained where he saw movement.  A large, brownish red animal was peeking out from behind the tree.  The animal was swaying back and forth from behind the tree.  The animal appeared to be squatted down swaying/peeking out from behind the tree.  It had a large head with a large brow line, large shoulder, and nose.  The nose and upper lip appeared to be a lighter color than rest of the animal seen.  We took our sport camera and tried to take pictures of the animal but it was about 40 feet up a hillside.  (We have a blurry picture but it appears to have a large animal head in the picture.)    As we watched the animal sway back and forth we heard a large knock behind us to the left, towards the lake, then heard a knock up towards the animal we saw then back behind us.  The feeling was very odd and made us feel very uncomfortable.  My husband wanted to hike out but due to the late evening I suggested we stay and hike out first thing in the morning.  We carry a large knife, bear spray, and a gun with us so I felt somewhat safe.  It was a very restless night and first daylight we packed our bags and left.  After hiking out and getting in the car to drive off we discussed what we witnessed and both could not explain what we saw.  This has taught me not to throw rocks against trees!

My dad liked to rough it compared to most. Sleep under the stars or in an old military tent and take only a few pots and a couple of fishing poles was pretty much all luxury we had except for two trips. I don't remember the circumstances of this particular trip but it was one of only two camping trips we took on the East Slope and one of the only two times I didn't sleep in a tent or under the stars. The first trip was over by Red Feathers Lakes where they were draining the ponds and bears were thicker than gnats so my dad had me and my sister sleep in his friend's popup camper. The second trip was the on west side of Pike's Peak where we went camping with some of my dad's friends. My sister and I were young definitely preteen or younger. My dad's friends had gotten there before us maybe even the night before and had camp all set up by the time we had arrived. I remember marveling at the camp set up because they had a \\\"big\\\" camper trailer that slept 6 or 8 and a table to cook on. I don\\u2019t know if this was in a structured camping area or some backcountry area. But I don\\u2019t recall any other campsite in close proximity. I don't remember much of the details except my sister and I were repeatedly told to stay real close to camp (this was somewhat unusual) and the adults were talking about something but would stop talking about it when they thought us girls could hear them (not unusual at all). Anyway, the evening ended pretty early for a camping trip (after 11:00 but before midnight) and everyone ended up sleeping in the camper trailer. My sister and I were in the bed in the front and on top of the full size bed where I think my dad's friends slept. My dad and his girlfriend slept in the dinning area where the table converted into a sleeping area. I slept by the front window so my sister could get to the bathroom easier. Beside me was a long window (at least 3' long and 6\\\" tall) that had these little curtains hanging from them. Sometime during the night I woke up and I could hear very heavy breathing. It took me some time to figure out what I was hearing but to this day I do not believe it was coming from inside the trailer. I could easily distinguish my sister's heavy breathing, my dad's loud snoring, his friends\\u2019 snoring, and my dad's girlfriend's deep breathing. While trying to figure out whose snoring was whose I remember hearing a \\\"chatter\\\" but I couldn't understand it. There wasn't much chatter but it was close, right down by my feet. Then the heavy breathing was next to the window. I don\\u2019t know if there were more than one of these things breathing heavily by the window but I could hear the breathing down by one end of the window by my feet, and then closer by my head. I do remember the tone and volume of the breathing sounding very much same at both ends,  as if something was moving from one end of the window to the other. I remember listening very intently to this trying to figure out how many and thinking that whatever it was would have to hop over the trailer hitch to get from one end of the window to the other. By this time the heavy breathing and \\u201cchatter\\u201d had been going on for several minutes and I was frozen with fear, the hair on my arms standing on end and unable to utter a word. I remember trying to call my dad but no sound came out. I remember just praying that my dad would hear it too, wake up and the sounds would end. I tried pulling on my sister\\u2019s leg so she\\u2019d wake up and it would go away but she always could sleep through a hurricane much less her little sister bothering her sleep. After sometime of listening to the breathing move right outside the window I worked up enough courage to take a peek out the window.  I took a corner of the curtain and pulled it back enough for me to see a few inches out the window. There was a light on somewhere outside, enough for me to see more than just darkness. I was expecting or hoping to see nothing outside, but I saw a pair of brown eyes just inches from my face staring right back at me. I quickly pushed the curtain closed and laid there completely paralyzed with fear. I don\\u2019t remember much more except the breathing stopped shortly after that and I must have somehow fallen back to sleep before first light. I do remember the next morning my sister complaining that I had wet the bed and the adults saying that \\u201cwhatever it was took all of the apples and potatoes\\u201d out of the back of the truck. I do remember some details of what I saw staring at me. It was right next to, almost touching the window like it was peering in to see. I saw something from just above where one\\u2019s eyebrows would be to somewhere in the middle of its nose. I don\\u2019t recall seeing the end of its nose or even the nostrils or the sides of its face. Its skin was dark brown or black and was the same shade around the eyes, nose and lower forehead. I don\\u2019t recall seeing any hair or fur. Its nasal ridge was not pronounced like a human\\u2019s or a bear\\u2019s, in fact I can\\u2019t recall seeing much of one. I do remember an eyebrow ridge but I don\\u2019t recall how pronounced it was. Its eyes were set somewhat back from the eyebrow ridge and where ones check bones would be. To describe the eyes without being too anthropomorphic - the eyes did not have a cold or lifeless appearance but rather a stunned but processing appearance.\", \"SEASON\": \"Fall\"},\n",

I have been a big game guide for several years and I am in the process of opening my on outfit. I must admit I have always been skeptical about bigfoot until now. Two years ago in 98 I was packing in clients into the Pike Natl forrest. Myself and another guide along with four clients were on our way out and got a late start. With only a few miles to go we were in total darkness along a trail. My horse stopped with out command and got very anxious. I assumed it was another animal or at worst a mountain lion. I eagrly tried to get him to move forward and he would not. I got off my horse and led him up the trail. Coming around a bend in the trail a creature standing at least 7 foot tall and covered in dark hair crossed the trail not twenty feet infront of me. It walked on two legs and was out of sight in two or three steps, but what amazed me was that it didn't make any noise as it disappeared into the very steep valley below. Another thing I found disturbing was the faint smell in the air. I hunt and guide hunters for mostly elk and 9 times out of ten I will smell them before I see them. This was no elk, bear, or mountain lion. After the incident, I was careful to lead the horses to one side of the trail not to disturb any tracks. The next day after getting my clients to the airport I returned on foot and was shocked to find a track, I placed my foot beside it and it was at least another 8 to 10\\\" past my boot. I wear a size 10. No one has ever spoken about the incident and no one will admit what they saw.I've tried several times to talk about it but know one will admit it.I have held this secret inside until now.Last year while hunting in the same area alone I had a close encounter and was able to observe in length of what I saw that night. I was hunting in a remote camp that is a 1/2 days pack in on foot. No one else hunts this country and I have never seen sign of people in the past. I had made camp at the bottom of a valley that held some remarkable bulls in it. There is a stream that runs through the valley and at the top, it is cut off by large cliffs that unless you are a professional rock climber is un passable. Through out the valley runs a series of beaver ponds and I was camped at the last one at the bottom. I arrived at the valley around 4:00 pm and set up my camp. I started a fire and prepared dinner. After a restless nights sleep, due to the anticipation of big bulls, I woke up at 3:00am and fixed breakfast, gathered my gear and was off by 4:30 or 5:00am. I hiked up the valley to a area I have always seen elk. This particular morning the wind was not coming down off the mountain instead it was swirling. I decided to sit on top of an out cropping and use the height to my advantage and try not to spook any animals. As the sun was coming up, I bugled several times looking for a response. I heard a bull elk respond in the same direction that I took coming up. I quickly started to glass the area in search of the bull. As I was working my way up the valley I heard the bull again. I went with my glasses to where I thought I had heard the bugle and when I glassed around the beaver pond that's when I saw it. I saw a very dark object squatting beside the beaver pond. At first I hought it was a bull lying in the pond. The creature stood up and was looking around. When he looked at me or in my direction, I got the feeling he knew I was there, and a feeling of excitement and terror filled my body. The creature was again around 7 foot tall maybe taller but not much.And it had short dark brown almost a reddish coat. It had facial features of that of a human, with the exception of a human nose. It was smaller and looked as if it sat on his mouth.Another feature that stood out to me was the size of it's hands. They were long and were like 1/2 the size of it's forearm. For the first time ever I was truely scared. Not of what I saw but of not ever really seeing anything like this before and having to face a reality. After at least 5 minutes of observing the creature he turned and walked through the creek towards my camp. He then turned and walked up a ridge and stopped and watched my camp or at least in that direction. After he moved off I got down off my perch and ran to my camp. I packed my gear and have yet to go back in there.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Woodland Park, CO.\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Hwy 67\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Just North of Pikes Peak at the bottom of the Craigs.

That morning we had located a herd of elk in some remote country and had stalked to their location to find that it was only cows. Since we had bull tag only we did not pursue but instead went out on the point of a mountain to glass for any potential bulls. As our party was sitting and glassing I called periodically hoping for a response from a bull. To my surprise (all of our surprise) we heard a low guttural moan. At first I thought it to be a bull bedded down but the second time I realized that it was no bull at all and could not possibly be a bear. I immediately went toward the noise to confirm what ever had made it and found no animals, no elk, deer, bear, etc. Shortly after hearing and investigating the sound I moved the party up the mountain to a aspen grove where I knew mid-day bulls would visit to eat. Shortly after positioning the hunters my wife and I took a position higher up the mountain to get a better view and for calling. After sitting in the grove for less than an hour we heard logs being hit together. Not like two bulls fighting but more like someone taking a sizeable log and hitting against another. The end of the day came and we returned to the camp and the hunt was over. That night two inches of snow fell and I went back to the same location and found a dead cow elk with only her chest cavity being open and from what I could tell having most of her internal organs.

Its rustling is what I think woke me up. So I got up to take him out, but I froze as did my blood. I was suddenly wide awake. I just stared because to the left of me I saw the silouette of a tall two legged creature through the door( we had zipped up the screen and left the cover off ).  I was and still am sure that it was not a bear or any other animal, and I am especially sure it was no human. Its arms were shorter than its legs and it was covered with hair. I got the feeling it was alarmed because right when stopped a jerked its head and walked speadlily away. My eyes were glued to it and I watched its every move. It walked away towards the field, turned around, and I lost sight of it. I can still remember thinking about the way it moved. It definatly was not normal. It bent at the knee and when it turned, it seemed like its whole upper body moved around. Of course the next day when I told my family no one believed me, but I know and I have known that it is a fact that sasquatch is real and is a living breathing animal. I also believe that it is not a threat. I definatly encourage people who are trying to bring sasquatch into reality for others for the right reasons.

My father was an avid hunter and fisherman. He always had binoculars with him as he liked to look at everything. He was up around Walden, CO and saw what he thought were two bears stalking an elk. I don't know if the elk was part of a herd or was cut out and was alone. Evidently, it did not know it was being stalked. Dad said he was a long way off, he was on one side of a mountain and this was happening across a valley on the side of another mountain in a partly open area. There is heavy timber in part of this area. When he got out his binoculars and started watching, he still thought they were two bears until they started walking. He said they were a brown color and quite large when they stood up and started walking on two legs. He watched them for about five minutes, until they got into some heavy timber. They did not stalk real close together- they had the elk in the middle. He said they were excellent stalkers and would even hide behind a tree for a while. He said he didn't know if they killed the elk or not but thought they probably did. He was sure they were carnivores or they wouldn't have been stalking in this manner. The incident took place in the late afternoon. There were very few people living in the area but who knows, there may still be some of the critters up there.

About 20-25 minutes later I was in the kitchen area when my co-worker screamed \\\"GET OUT HERE QUICK.\\\" So I headed to the front just in time to see a very large hairy looking thing just walking down the street right under a light as casual as could be.

Then it walked a few more feet and turned next to a fence and walked past a car wash and storage unit and out of sight.

The tracks caught Bill's attention because a different Colorado fisherman (Vern P. of Grand Junction, Colorado) reported finding a number of 18 to 20 inch long human-like tracks along the same river a few days prior.

I arrived in the area Tuesday the 17th of June.  We had spent several days in the area, including trips to Mesa Verde, horseback riding on West Mountain in the Weminuche Wilderness, and fourwheeling up FR 724 on Middle Mountain. Friday morning (the 20th), we drove into Durango and rented a couple of late model Jeeps.  We drove out to attempt a drive on FR 682 but found it closed due to a recent fire.  The Jeep rental folks had suggested FR 578 as an alternate if we found 682 closed, so we proceeded north on US 550 to the Purgatory\\\\Durango Mountain Resort area and picked up FR 578.  At the junction we followed FR 578 and took it up through the Graysill Mine and Graysill ghost town, over Bolam Pass, and then west from the junction with TR 638. We followed FR 578 until the trail terminates at a berm installed on a spur of FR 578, presumably installed to close the trail to motorized traffic.  While my wife and daughter and I stopped to eat lunch, my sister, brother-in-law and father hiked towards the base of Hermosa Peak (12,579 ft).  I estimate we were at approximately 11,500 to 12,000 feet, near the timberline. When they returned from their hike (about 3 PM), my sister (age 28) reported that she had noticed what she thought looked like a large bare human footprint on a closed portion of trail, approximately \\u00bc mile WSW from the berm. Having been interested in the Bigfoot phenomenon for some time, I though she might be pulling my leg but I took my video camera and we walked down the path together, looking for where she thought she had seen the footprint.  We noticed a large amount of Elk sign in the area, and what appeared to be motorcycle tire tracks. We had not noticed anything and had actually started back towards the area where the Jeeps were parked when she found the print.  I videotaped the print, and compared my hiking boot (size 12) to the print.  The print appeared to be perhaps 2 inches longer than my hiking boot which measures 12\\u00be inches, and about 1 to 2 inches wider than my hiking boot which measures about 5 inches wide, making the print approximately 14\\u00bd or 15 inches long by about 6 to 7 inches wide.  The print had what appeared to be a clear heel line, foot shape, ball print and toe marks.  The print appeared to be a left foot. As we continued towards the Jeeps, we found another print, much more clear than the previous print about 3\\u00bd to 4 feet away.  When we first observe this print I am clearly heard on the tape to say \\u201cOh my God\\u201d because the print was so obvious.  This print appeared to be a right foot.  Relative size compared to my hiking boot was similar to that noticed on the first print.  This print had more definition of the heel print, arch and ball print, indicated flexibility due to a sharp rock that would have been near the center of the foot, and had five very distinct toe marks.  The rock appeared to have been displaced either by whatever made the print, or subsequent to that by the passing of Elk or my family.  My sister joked at this point that \\u201che stubbed his toe\\u201d due to the shape of the print and proximity to other rocks. About 3 or 4 feet further along the trail (heading back ENE) we found a third print that was not as easy to distinguish but which approximately matched the distance from the first to second print and was again similar in size.  The ground on the trail was getting progressively harder and more stoney, but this appeared to be a left foot again. No further prints were observed as we made our way back to the Jeeps, but we continued to observe Elk prints made in the muddy sides of the closed trail (evidenced by curling and ridges on the prints). I initially took the whole event in a rather non-serious way, even though I have been a real student of Bigfoot stories and research for sometime, especially during my teens and early twenties.  In hindsight, we could have marked the prints and tried to take more accurate measurements of gait, print size, even sketched them, as well as heading back down the trail (towards Hermosa Peak) where the ground was softer and more likely to have recorded additional prints.  We also could have looked around the area for other signs, there were several nearby stands of trees, snow and other fresh water sources. I do have several minutes of video that includes the surrounding area to verify my location and for reference, and this includes some clear images of all three prints.  I weigh about 180 pounds and made very little in the way of tracks in the dirt, with only occasional traces of boot tread showing in the same area.  I do not recall noticing ridges on the prints indicating they were not likely made while the ground was overly wet or muddy. I am 33, do not drink or smoke, work in management at an aerospace company, and am married with a 7 year old daughter.  Having had several days now to think about this event, and to have gauged the reactions of the few folks I have told about our observations, I am still not exactly sure what we saw and what I taped, but it definitely appears to be large humanoid footprints, made in varying terrain, showing a 3 to 4 foot gait and a foot that is somewhere near 14 or 15 inches long and about 6 or 7 inches wide. I am not a great outdoorsman but I am aware that some bear prints can appear almost human, but the video shows what I believe to have been clear human or humanoid footprints with no evidence of claws as on a bear. Honestly, the thought now that we might have seen footprints of a large animal such as Bigfoot is quite unsettling, and made me uneasy at night, both while in the cabin near Vallecitos, and even at my home in Rio Rancho, near Albuquerque. I can be available for any follow-up or to try and make copies of the video available if desired.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Silverton\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Just off FR 578\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Near the timberline, about 11,500 feet.

It was the September muzzleloading hunt which runs from the second to the third weekend of the month. We had drove in quite a ways. We hunted the morning and I had seen nothing. About 9 or 10 am I had spotted a bear up higher so I figured we had better move to a new location, for the bear may have spooked any deer in the area. We walked down the trail to our truck and left the area. The time from seeing the bear until we left was about 20 minutes. The bear was heading north-east. We drove south-west down the mountain about 30 to 45 minutes. When we came around the corner of the road, it overlooked Wolf Park and a hill on the south side. My friend and I saw them at the same time. He slammed on the brakes and we bailed from the truck. We both started glassing 2 of the creatures standing in an opening. They turned and started looking at us. That amazed me because of the distance. It was quite a distance away. With the naked eye you could make out the size of the creatures, which - between that and the fact that they were standing up -  made us stop. We looked at them about 3 to 5 minutes and then 3 small ones walked out of the draw the parents had come from. They were about half the size of the parents. The creatures were jet black and you could see the arms and legs, torso and head. They started moving back to cover when a white pick-up came out on the road below us which was about 75 to 100 yards from where the largest one was. The truck came to an quick stop for 10 to 15 seconds,  and then took off like a bat out of hell. The creatures disappeared into the brush. We drove to the spot we had seen them and looked at where they had gone. The slope was pretty steep and real loose. The dirt was so loose you could see that with each step they slid so I could not find a real good print. I had to jump in order to reach from one step to the other. The brush was thick in this draw were they had gone so we did not go looking for them. We left and went home. We talked about it for a week or two. It had gotten us excited but we never told anybody about this. I tried to bring it up one time a few years ago in conversation to my friend but he avoided the topic.

But, again, this was after our sighting on the Ophir Creek Road\", \"STATE\": \"Colorado\", \"OBSERVED\": \"In late July of 1998 my youngest son (who was 18 then)and I lived in Western Arkansas and took a week-long camping trip to the Wet Mountains in Colorado west of Pueblo.  I had done most of the driving to get there and we arrived there well after midnight searching for a place to camp and fish.  My son does not enjoy crowds when camping so we looked for some place \\\"out of the way\\\" yet not too remote.  We drove up a forest service road near Ophir Creek looking for a campground we had seen a sign for.  As I recall it was probably three or four in the morning.  I know it was still dark outside.  We located the campground, but unfortunately it appeared to be operated not by the Forest Service but by a private individual who had very opposing views to the government and authority in general, as evidenced by a very descriptive sign at the entrance to the \\\"campground\\\".  My son and I continued on up the forest service road toward a place we later found to be Blue Lakes near Greenhorn Mountain.  As we were driving up this road which wound in an out of pine trees and open meadows we came to a long straight stretch of road.  As I approached this straight part of the road I notice a small \\\"pocket\\\" of trees illuminated by my headlights on the left side of the road.  The trees bordered the road there, but it was open meadow leading up to the pocket of trees.  In the center of the stand of trees I saw an orange light that I at first took to be a reflector on a pole or stick marking the road. As I got within twenty or thirty yards of the trees I seemed to notice movement and thought someone was walking in the trees and smoking a cigarette and I was seeing the \\\"cherry\\\" at the tip of the cigarette.  I still felt no cause for concern and remember thinking facetiously that it was one of the \\\"Ophir Creek Campground Wackos\\\" out for a four in the morning recon. I continued to drive up the road and watched the orange light fade as the lights no longer shined directly into the trees.  As we rolled by my son said \\\"Dad?\\\" in a questioning tone.  He had seen the orange light/reflection also and was pointing into the trees to the left.  I noticed a large rock in the periphery of my headlights and something standing behind the rock turning it's head to follow the movement of my truck as we drove past the trees at the edge of the road.  It was probably ten to fifteen feet off the road.  I started to brake but something inside said don't stop so I didn't.  What I saw in those few moments was definitely humanoid or bipedal, whatever you want to call it.  It was standing perfectly erect, not slumped and was definitely watching my pickup and turning it's head and upper body to keep my truck in sight.  The large rock hid the lower half of the body but I could see a vague outline of it's torso (from about where the navel would be on a human being), shoulders, and head as I passed.  I do not recall seeing any distinct outline of arms in the very brief time this happened.  I would say the whole incident took 15 to thirty seconds to transpire.  I drove on up the road watching my mirror but saw nothing in the red glow of my taillights.  I looked over at my son whose only comment was, \\\"did we just see what I think we saw?\\\"  I told him \\\"yes, I think we did.\\\"  We drove on up to Blue Lakes and talked about what we had seen and then took a short nap (with the doors locked) waiting for daylight so we could set up camp.  Later that morning after daylight had come and we set up camp, we drove back down the road to the stand of trees and got out to look around.  The ground was covered in pine needles (except the road area and a creek bed about twenty of thirty yards away.)  We both stood by the large rock and realized the \\\"creature\\\" had to have been 7 to 7-1/2 feet tall because the top of the rock was at the level of our chests  (he and I are 5'10\\\" tall).  We found one spot in the edge of the road where it appeared something had come down off the hillside on the right side of the road.  There were no distinct tracks in the packed gravel of the road, but there were two spots where small rocks (maybe thumbnail size) had been disturbed and pushed from the roadside toward the hillside (90 degrees from the direction of normal vehicle travel).  I took several photos of the stand of trees, the large rock, the marks on the roadside and an indistinct depression in the moist edge of the creek.

The creatures head was level with the awning on the porch of the cabin, 8 foot above the ground where it was standing. They at first thought it was a bear standing on its hind legs on the porch, but as they got closer they realized that it was in front of the cabin and on the ground. The creature then ran downhill and across a stream and into the forest out of sight. They were not close enough to it to see any detailed features, only that it was a tall, black, and ran on its hind legs. My father looked for tracks, but because of the rocky nature of the ground he found only one relatively good track near the stream. He said the track was about 17 to 18\\\" long and the toes were distinct and humanlike. The great toe was about as large as the bare heel track of a man. In 1991, my cousin had his large RV almost tipped over in the night, with him in it, as something grabbed the RV, and rocked it violently. He stayed up the rest of the night, with pistol in hand. In the morning a box of apples was missing, box and all. In 1995, through casual conversation with some campers at the near by Lake Fork Campground, that something had rocked another RV, in the night.

It was near sunset and the sun had already gone behind the mountains. There was a sparsly forested rise toward the southwest,above the beaver pond we were fishing. Just beyond this rise was the south slope of a ridge of old growth forest. A horrible gravelly scream or yell of almost unbelievable volume came from just inside the forest at about 150 to 200 yards distance. I am an avid bowhunter of 20 years experience with all manner of big game and the sound was definitely not an elk or bear. Elk make some loud and unusual sounds but this sound was vastly different and many times louder. I noticed that a light breeze was blowing from us toward the source of the sound. If the creature had a good sense of smell, it was probably smelling us. Bowhunting experience has taught me that an elk would smell us under the same conditions. The sound had a threatening essence to it. The sound itself was kind of undescribable and seemed louder than a creature could possibly make. Whatever made the two tone scream must have one big set of lungs and a very large, megaphone size, mouth. The sound lasted about 1 or 2 seconds and was repeated three times, with a 10 or 15 second pause between each blast of noise. I was unarmed and decided since I had my sons with me I would give the creature its space. We left. I was somewhat alarmed, but would have gone to the source of the sound if I had not had my sons with me. I did go to the area of the source of the sound the next morning alone at sunrise to see if I could find tracks or other evidence of the source of the sound. I some very old large tracks in soft dirt on a flat area about 1/2 mile uphill. They were about 16\\\" by 8\\\" in size but too old to descern any toes or other detail and could have been bear tracks distorted and enlarged by rains and time. There was a line of about 20 of these large tracks in single file across the bare ground of this bench. Most of the rest of the soil in this area is too rocky to see the tracks of soft footed animals well. The tracks I found were at least a week or two old.

We parked on highway 6 where it crosses the continental Divide and hiked south along the divide for about five miles.

We had descended below the tree line where the valley peteres out into a boggy meadow.  This meadow runs down to a stream to the immediate east.  The stream is large at this point and I think this is the same stream that can be seen from Interstate 70 at the Eisenhower tunnel several miles north at the Loveland ski resort.  Dense brush and tree cover run along the opposite bank. We began to hear what we thought were noises from a large animal across the stream.  We tried approaching the source of the noise, but as we moved closer the sound moved away downstream along the opposite bank.  I started catching glimpses of a large, hairy, brown and black animal and thought we were following a bear.  My friend had the same idea and our pace slowed to a halt.  The animal then moved a little closer to us and appeared to watch us for several seconds.  Its height made it look like a bear reared up on its hind legs.  It then turn and moved off downstream through the brush in a long, loping, two legged gate that would have been impossible for a bear.  We did not care to follow. Adding to my belief that what we saw was not a bear or other wild animal is the fact that my dog did not bark or show any of the aggressive excitement he usually displays upon encountering a wild animal.

It stood on two legs at all times and sometimes it rocked back and forth. At that time I assumed that this was because it wanted to get our scent or to get a better view. We then decided to run for it. We came down the hill at breakneck speed, and were scolded  by our parents who thought we could have broken a leg running so fast down the hill. My parents claimed it was a bear. But, I have been hunting and fishing these mountains for thirty years. I have never seen a grizzly bear in this part of the state.

We built a tiny 12 x 16' cabin and squeezed ourselves in there on the south side of the mountain about 2/3 of the way along the original little mining road. The cabin was on only level land on a heavily treed and rocked parcel. The north side of the cabin snugged right up against the mountain slope with pine trees all around.

      "{\"REPORT_NUMBER\": \"1350\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class A\", \"COUNTY\": \"Conejos County\", \"DATE\": \"4\", \"MONTH\": \"August\", \"YEAR\": \"1998\", \"STATE\": \"Colorado\", \"OBSERVED\": \"REPORT OF A FIELD INVESTIGATION by Richard D. McCuistion, Sr., Chilton Williamson, and Keith Foster  Between 4 and 7 August 1998 we began a long term study in a drainage thought to be the summer range of the Sasquatch(s) described by Foster in the Big Foot Research Organization\\u2019s geographical data base for Conejos County, Colorado.  Our purpose was to spend at least six days in the study area to establish our presence deep into, what we thought might be, the home range of the creature and to familiarize ourselves with the area.  Exact locations within Townships 35 and 36 North and Range 4 East will not be divulged here because of the area\\u2019s importance to us as a long term study area.  Also, it is not recommended that anyone, other than serious researchers who coordinate their activities in the area with us, venture into this area because of its remoteness and the unusual occurrences that we experienced. The study area is heavily timbered with slopes ranging from about 10% (6\\u00a7) to over 100% (45\\u00a7) and elevations ranging from 9400 feet above mean sea level (MSL) to over 12,000 feet above MSL.  The off road terrain is extremely rough and suitable campsites are almost nonexistent.  The soils are granitic, very firm, and not particularly conducive to animals with soft feet leaving discernible tracks -- shod horses weighing 1,000 pounds or more generally left slight hoof impressions in the surface of the dirt road.  The study area is summer range for an apparently sizable population of elk (Cervus elaphus).  The cow elk and their calves that I observed were numerous, well fed, and healthy.  I believe that this population serves as a prey base for the alleged resident sasquatch(es) as well as other large predators including man.  No evidence of bears was seen on this trip, but that does not preclude them from existing there. The first twenty-one hours spent in the study area by Williamson and me were uneventful.  We found a suitable campsite that had a fire ring and other evidence of recent human usage -- possibly by seasonal elk hunters.  The campsite lay between dense forest and rising terrain on the north-northwest, east and southeast sides and a large wet meadow that drains into the _________ Creek on the west side. The meadow covers an area of about 230 acres and is oriented on a northwest-southeast axis.  It was about 250 yards wide west-southwest of our campsite. At 16:00 MDT, 5 August 1998, Williamson and I heard five distinct primate-like calls apparently originating from an 11,000 foot high ridge north of the campsite.  The vocalizations resembled those of a large man rising from a low pitch to a higher pitch before ending -- something like \\\"Uuuuhhhhaaaa - Uuuuhhhhaaaa\\\" and were similar to the vocalizations that I heard near Leadville during the early morning of 23 October 1994.  The vocalizations stopped before they could be recorded.  To our knowledge, no other humans were within four and a half miles of our campsite.  A possible hiker\\u2019s camp was observed by us as we drove into the area the previous day. It was approximately four and a half miles southeast of our camp and was next to the access road and a pack trail leading up to _______Peak.  This camp was located at about 9400 feet above MSL and the intervening, rough, and heavily wooded terrain rose to over 11,000 feet above MSL.  By road, the distance between camps was greater than seven miles.  At about 16:30 MDT, we were joined by Keith Foster and his son Andrew.  We discussed the vocalizations and it was noted that our campsite was about ______ miles from the site of Foster\\u2019s scream encounter of June 1994. At about 01:40 MDT, 6 August 1998, Williamson was awakened by an undetermined disturbance.  Since he had decided to keep his horses in their trailer that night, it may have been their movements in the trailer that awakened him.  At about 01:57 MDT, he heard a vocalization coming from nearby that sounded something like \\\"Ahhhh - uuuhhhh\\\" -- a diminutive, rhythmic, and almost conversational form of the vocalization heard the preceding afternoon.  Also, this vocalization was repeated several times and was followed by a pair of low, sharp clicks as if two hard objects or rocks were being struck together.  Foster also heard the clicks.  The vocalization seemed to emanate from a small ridge less than a quarter of a mile northeast of our campsite.  Unfortunately, Williamson was unable to awaken me sufficiently for me to corroborate his observations. After daybreak on 6 August, we observed several elk cows and their calves grazing on a bench about one half mile southwest and upslope of our campsite.  Several bulls were observed bedded down above the timberline on the east-northeast slopes of _______Peak.  After breakfast, we conducted a brief examination of the area north of our campsite, but nothing unusual was observed.  Foster and his son departed to examine the bait sites that he had established near the site of his scream encounter.  These bait sites were established in mid-July 1998 and were designed to collect hair samples and hand prints.  Williamson and I rode the horses further down the drainage following a closed logging road.  We rode about one and a half miles down-drainage before coming to the end of the closed road.  We found the road washed out and impassable by vehicle.  At the road\\u2019s end, we found a major game trail that continued down the_________Creek drainage, but we elected not to follow it because of the deadfall and snags which made going impossible for the horses.  While at this location, I took the opportunity to pound rhythmically on a hollow log with a large rock for about 30 minutes;  my effort, however, elicited no response.  We retraced our path to our campsite and rode beyond it to an old clear-cut.  The exact date of the cut is not known, but it shows up on the aerial photography taken on 29 August 1989 as a recently disturbed area.  This clearcut is now an open meadow with slopes of about 10% to 20% and is covered with a generous growth of grasses, sedges, and some pine saplings ten or twelve feet in height. Numerous cow and calf elk tracks, along with recently used beds, were observed throughout this area. At 18:03 MDT, 6 August 1998, numerous and sustained primate-like screams or roars were heard by Williamson and me reverberating around our campsite. The direction from which the vocalizations emanated could not be determined, and the quality of the calls seemed to have a definite edge or harshness over the vocalizations heard the previous day.  They sounded something like \\\"Rrrrraaaahhhh - Rrrrraaaahhhh!\\\".  These vocalizations lasted for about four minutes and, again, I was unable to record them.  The horses were securely tethered to the rear of their trailer and we turned in for the night at about 22:30 MDT which coincided with the rising of a full moon. At about 02:00 MDT, 7 August 1998, Williamson and I were awakened by Foster\\u2019s vehicle alarm system, which caused a few moments of pandemonium, and Foster shouting, \\\"False alarm!\\\".  He then advised us of the events preceding the alarm\\u2019s activation.  He stated that he had been awake when he began to hear a rhythmic rock-clacking 50 to 100 yards north of the campsite.  The sounds of two rocks being struck together began at about 01:40 MDT.  He described the sound as having a definite cadence of one strike per second and lasting for a period about twenty seconds.  He observed that the horses were fully alert , extremely nervous or frightened, stamping and snorting and both of them were trying to position the horse trailer between themselves and the source of the rock-clacking.  There were no slopes around the campsite steep enough for a dislodged rock to tumble down and duplicate the steady cadence that he heard.  Upon hearing the clacking and observing the fright exhibited by the horses, he attempted to lower the window of his sport utility vehicle in order to hear better, but inadvertently activated the alarm system which caused Williamson and me to respond to the emergency with weapons at the ready. The events leading up to the alarm were discussed, especially the horses\\u2019 exhibited behavior.  They are experienced mounts for deer and elk hunting and have been used on numerous such hunts to pack out downed game.  They have also been exposed to bear which, according to their owner, frighten them considerably.  Foster expressed the opinion that no further incidents would be forthcoming because of the noise made by the alarm and our activity and then he retired for the night.  Williamson and I decided to maintain a listening watch.  Within 45 minutes after activity in the camp subsided, the horses began to alert again and, with the aid of a sound amplifying device, Bionic Ear, stealthy, creeping footfalls could be heard.  Although the device had a directional parabola, there was enough spurious background noise from over-flying jet aircraft to make precise directional orientation difficult; still, the footfalls that I heard were definitely not the thudding noise made by the horses or other hoofed animals as they walk.  It became apparent that the horses were confirming what I was hearing and that they were giving us an accurate bearing on the intrusions.  The horses never alerted toward the meadow on our open west-southwest flank. To aid us in our surveillance, we also used a pair of night vision goggles, but despite a full moon and the unit\\u2019s infrared spotlight, viewing into the shadows wasn\\u2019t very productive because of the jumble created by branches and snags.  A four celled Mag-Lite was also used to pan suspected areas and at about 04:00 MDT red eye-shine was detected.  The eye-shine appeared as two parallel, reddish pinpoints which winked off and on at about the same visible plane as the base, and to the side of, a lone tree growing on the southwest rim of a small swale.  The swale began about 15 yards north of the horse trailer and was approximately 25 yards in diameter.  A person of average height standing in it would be unable to see over the rim and into our campsite.  The eye-shine\\u2019s color was consistent with the red or orange reported by Grover Krantz (\\\"Big Foot-Prints\\\", 1992), while the color of the eye-shine cast by the horses was lime green.  Despite a full moon and clear meteorological conditions, no grazing elk or other nocturnal animals were observed at any time during the night.  (An absence of browsing deer and nocturnal animals was previously reported by me in my report of the alleged sasquatch screams and response calls that I heard near Leadville, CO in October 1994.)  The meteorological conditions then were basically the same as on the morning of 7 August 1998.  Moonset occurred at about 05:30 MDT. The intrusions occurred at intervals of one every 45 to 60 minutes and always began with the horses alerting in a different direction toward the forest around us.  Stealthy footfalls and movements would be detected and we would wait until we were absolutely sure that an animal was close by; then we would unzip the tent\\u2019s insect netting and pan the suspected area with the night vision goggles or the Mag-Lite. An interesting, and I believe important, observation is of the horse\\u2019s behavior preceding successive intrusions.  They were becoming more accepting of whatever was encroaching upon our campsite.  Bears are ruled out because they were not observed and the horses did not exhibit the fear reaction they are known to show in a their presence. After daybreak, the area around the campsite was examined for tracks and other disturbances.  The ground\\u2019s surface was, as stated previously, very firm and fairly even, with a layer of pine needle duff under the trees and grasses and sedges in the open areas.  Rock outcrops occurred throughout, and the open areas were moist from a heavy dew and a light rain shower from the previous afternoon.  An animal\\u2019s bed was found about 90 yards north of the campsite under a tree above the northern rim of the swale.  This position or bed provided an excellent, but screened, view of our campsite. The bed was dry and appeared fresh, and I did not observe any hoofprints or footprints in or around it although the soil and duff were disturbed.  There was no detectable odor in the bed.  Foster picked up two base-ball sized rocks and struck them together to demonstrate the sound he had heard earlier that morning.  The noise he produced startled the horses and elicited their undivided attention during the demonstration.  Conclusions: 1.  Primate-like vocalizations were heard on three separate occasions between 5 and 7 August 1998.  The vocalizations heard in the afternoons of 5 and 6 August 1998 could not have been made by a human without the aid of a megaphone because of the dense forest and vegetation which quickly attenuated sound.  These vocalizations lasted for a period of not more than five minutes each occurrence and were definitely produced by a living animal and not by a tape player.  The vocalizations heard on 5 August had, as interpreted by Williamson, a \\\"Heads up or general announcement\\\" quality to them, whereas those vocalizations heard on 6 August were more like \\\"Now hear this!\\\".  The vocalization heard during the early morning of 6 August had a conversational quality to it and was followed by a pair of low, sharp clicks which were also heard by Foster. 2. The footfalls and movements heard with the Bionic Ear were consistent with the night movement techniques that I learned during my training as a combat infantryman.  The technique was, basically, to place the toe of your boot carefully but firmly, avoiding branches, twigs, or dry leaves, and then gradually shift your weight to that foot so as to minimize the sound of vegetation being crushed or soil being shifted.  It is apparent to me now that the tent\\u2019s zipper broadcast our alertness and the panning spotlight confirmed it. 3.  The horses that we had with us were, initially, invaluable as an early warning system, but they seemed to become accepting of whatever it was that kept encroaching upon our campsite.  It appeared to their owner that they were beginning to show the same interest in the intruder(s) as they did when one of us approached them. 4.  We were not subjected to the same sort of intimidation or threat displays, such as screams, and thrashing of vegetation that others have reported in their sasquatch encounters.  This difference in behavior could have been due to our numbers and the nature of our presence in the area.  We all carried firearms, we actively scouted the area, we made drumming noises on a hollow log, we didn\\u2019t hunt the elk that abounded the area, and we remained vigilant during the night. 5.  Williamson and I had the distinct impression that we were dealing with an adversary rather than a curious and semi-intelligent animal. My conclusion is based on my personal instincts and experience as a former Marine who has seen some combat and Williamson\\u2019s was based on his \\\"gut feeling\\\" as he had no previous experience with anything like this.  We independently noted the change in the quality of the afternoon vocalizations between 5 August and 6 August, the use of non-verbal communication in the form of rock-clacking, and the repeated probing of our campsite on the morning of 7 August 1998.  The rock-clacking could be interpreted as a form of close range communication intended to mimic naturally occurring sounds which would not tend to alert a quarry.  According to Foster, such communication is sometimes used by bow hunters when hunting Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and Mountain Goats (Oreamnos americanus) because they tend to disregard the sound of falling rock 6.  The probing of a position is a complex, aggressive, and hostile act that is used to determine the strengths and weaknesses of an adversary. It is my opinion that the use of this device could only be made by an intelligent, sentient being or beings of potentially dangerous capability or intent.  Although there are no recently documented incidents of anyone being attacked by a sasquatch(es), the above described occurrences, the Ape Canyon incident described by John Green (\\\"On The Track of the Sasquatch\\\", 1980), and the reference to chimpanzee hunting behavior described by Jane Goodall (\\\"The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior\\\", 1986) caused my personal warning flags to go up.  Keith Foster\\u2019s \\\"gut feeling\\\" was that the encroachments on our campsite amounted to nothing more than simple curiosity. 7.  After considering all of the events leading up to the night of 6-7 August, Williamson and I decided to cut short our planned stay and to leave when Foster and his son left for their home in Kansas.  It was clear to us that our campsite could not be defended because of the surrounding terrain and forest and we did not want to test the intruder\\u2019s intelligence and tactical ability with just two people and a pair of increasingly relaxed  horses.  If we had, indeed, been probed the night before, we were obviously under constant surveillance and it would have been readily apparent to an intelligent being(s) that it had the advantage. 8. Although no conclusive evidence was found that would support a claim that our campsite had been visited or probed by a sasquatch(es), the area warrants further, and careful,  investigation which we intend to,  systematically, accomplish.\", \"SEASON\": \"Summer\"},\n",

Parting the foliage, I see the bull is mine at last.    Snapping a few quick photos, I\\u2019m hoping to slide the his sizeable mass down to a creek side flat for field dressing, but wedged in the tangle, it\\u2019s a case of too much elk and not enough me\\u2026 \\u2026Nightfall has now engulfed the landscape.  Stepping aside, by Braille I grope through my pack for a flashlight.  Successful, I turn its beam across the downed elk, only to be startled by the sounds of a heavy animal scrambling uphill from beside the carcass.   While my adrenal glands haven\\u2019t exactly been on vacation this evening, all sensory gauges are now pegged.   It appears I\\u2019m not the only one who has followed the blood trail. Shouting threats into the darkness, I\\u2019m hoping to make it clear to this interloper exactly who this elk meat belongs to. How could an animal come so close without detecting the feared human scent?   Having my share of bear-in-camp encounters, I\\u2019m confident that this creature will, as others always have, amble off in search of easier pickings.  Standing in the blackness of heavy canopy, I hear the crunching leaves from circling footfalls that tell me this time might be different.   Looking at my bow and one remaining arrow, I feel like I\\u2019m on safari with the proverbial switch.  I briefly consider building a fire to keep the animal at bay, but as I scan the surroundings I find only fresh aspen growth upon a hillside too steep to support a fire. While I\\u2019m generally a stickler for prompt field dressing, I\\u2019m hesitant to make myself vulnerable by turning my back to the night \\u2013 and whatever is out there watching me. Sunrise is eight hours away and I know that if this continues much longer, my flashlight\\u2019s batteries will begin to fade.   While pondering my dilemma, I hear footsteps and trickling beads of gravel dancing down the face of a rocky overhang directly behind me. I\\u2019m not sure what I\\u2019m up against, but something tells me it\\u2019s time to back away and leave the elk to whatever it is that\\u2019s skulking in the darkness.   Scanning for eye-shine with my failing flashlight, I descend the mountain, tying surveyor\\u2019s tape to aspen limbs to help me retrace my steps in the morning, and begin following the creek back to camp.   Moments into the journey I stop and cock an ear into the night. Fifteen yards into dense willows, I again detect footfalls, seemingly paralleling me.   I shouting once more.   I\\u2019m weary of all this, and not equipped to do anything other than continue on. It\\u2019s a long, mentally exhausting hike back to camp.  As soon as I get there I reach under a nearby log and feel the cold steel of my stashed .38.   Gazing to the stars, I reflect upon my night.   Unbelievably, I again hear the pacing of heavy footsteps on the wooded flat rising behind camp.   The pistol is an enormous confidence builder, and wanting to get to the bottom of this, I rush the bench only to hear heavy footsteps dash off through breaking brush.   Now, to have an animal come to a carcass is understandable, but why in the world would it pass up a freshly killed elk to follow me back to camp? Sleep is not going to come easy tonight. Even in the darkest woods, I\\u2019ve always been comfortable; it\\u2019s just the same beautiful forest with the lights turned off, right? But tonight, I\\u2019m truly unnerved.  Contemplating the 4-mile journey to the security of the Jeep, I realize - whatever it is - it\\u2019s still out there. After wrestling the elk, I\\u2019m sure I smell like one. Slipping into fresh clothes, I have a seat in a large clearing and scan the surroundings.  As meteors race across the moonless sky all seems calm, and soon my sleeping bag beckons. At first light I eat a quick breakfast and head out, fully expecting to find my bull the subject of somebody\\u2019s midnight snack.   An hour later, I\\u2019m ascending to the site. A metallic clang of the .38-barrel striking a Sierra Cup announces my approach to any lingering scavengers. Cautiously advancing, I\\u2019m amazed to find my bull intact. Hmmm\\u2026 why then, was I followed? \\u2026  \\u2026One question remains:  Why was I pressed off the downed bull \\u2013 then apparently followed back to camp?

For those famaliar with this geographical area, I was in a district of the forest known locally and on topo maps as 'Jacob's Hill.'  I have hunted and camped in this area for many many years.  It was in late September and I was sitting in front of my campfire around 9 pm when I heard the most bone chilling and indescribable wailing roar that I have ever heard.

The closest thing I could relate it to would be the noise of a hereford bull bellowing....but it was not that either.  The sound continued uninterrupted for about 5-10 seconds and then ceased.  Immediately coyotes from several different locales in the vicinity began howling and yelping as tho very disturbed.  I did not hear the noise again during that particular outing. Now, fast forward 2 months into November in camp in the same location for the elk hunting season. Bear in mind that until this moment in November I had not mentioned this incident to anyone.  I awoke at 4 AM one cold morning and noticed that someone else was awake and had built our camp fire again.  Because I was going to get up in another hour or so anyway, I got up and stepped outside.  It was my brother prowling around and I asked why he was up so early.  He replied that he had gotten up to go to the bathroom and the weirdest thing had happened.  I interrupted him immediately and told that before he told me what had happened I wanted to tell him about my experience.  I related to him the very story I told above.  When I was finished my brother just looked at me in amazement and said that is exactly what he had just experienced verbatim; right down to the coyotes reacting.

The South San Juan Wilderness (in the San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado) is considered to be Colorado\\u2019s wildest corner.  It was in the backcountry of this wilderness in the fall of either 1977 or 1979 (I forget which) that a sow Grizzly Bear was startled and attacked a bow hunter.  He was mauled but managed to kill the bear with an arrow he repeatedly drove into the bear\\u2019s chest.  It was thought that the Grizzly had long been extirpated from all of Colorado.  If there are Grizzlies still in Colorado, this is where they are thought to be. I have been hiking, backpacking, camping, and fly-fishing in this area for about six years now, making about 2-3 trips per spring/summer/fall and one of those trips usually includes a backpack into the backcountry.  I am very familiar with the sounds the various animals make in the forests and mountains of the west and of this specific area. On this trip I managed to sneak away for a three day weekend in mid-June with the new lab.  I heard that the Salmon-fly hatch had started and wanted to try to get a piece of the action fly-fishing for big, aggressive trout. I figured I would save myself a few dollars by not camping in the developed Forest Service campsites and enjoy some solitude at the same time.  So I camped in a large series of meadows known as the Trail Creek Primitive Camping area; no water, no services, just camp where you will.  I was about 15 miles from the tiny community of Platoro at the upper end of the Conejos valley and maybe 10-15 miles from the next nearest community of assorted vacation houses known as Rocky Mountain Estates back down the valley.  I did not realize it at the time but this was a remote area even though the dirt road that ran up and down the valley was only about a \\u00bd mile across the meadows from my camping spot.  Behind me by about 50 yards was the edge of a 150\\u2019 moderate canyon of the upper section of the Pinnacles run of the Conejos River.  On the other side of the canyon, which is steep but easily crossed by humans, is a huge, expansive mountainside of aspen groves, spruce and fir trees, and mountain meadows.  This is the beginning edge of the South San Juan Wilderness Area. The second evening I had cooked dinner and taken the lab out for a last evening walk around the meadows.  It had been a good day of fishing and we were both tired.  We went to bed in the tent just at dark.  It was a night of an almost full moon.  We both fell asleep quickly. A bit later I awoke and thought I head something outside the tent, probably a deer.  But because I was curious I sat awake for a bit and listened.  After about 10 minutes from out of nowhere I heard this unreal, LOUD, clear, resonant, scream/screech/howl/roar type sound from not too far away.  It sounded maybe 300-400 yards away and like it might have been just across the canyon on the mountainside.  It was like no sound I have ever heard in my life.  It was fairly high-pitched and did not have the rough, gravelly sound that cats have when they roar and call.  It was clear, even crisp, loud, and lasted for about 5-6 seconds.  It seemed to be two parts screaming howl and one part roar, as it had that deep quality but was still high-pitched.  I sat there for a minute stunned, and then realized what it must be. I have read accounts on this website before about the sounds these creatures supposedly make, and this was what came to mind.  (So I guess chance does favor the prepared mind.)  And it was not that far away.  The sound seemed to be coming directly toward me, like it might have been screaming at or towards me or this meadow area where people sometimes camp.  It felt territorial, aggressive, even a little threatening.  Even though I had a .357 loaded with hot hollow points and a strong flashlight, the prospect of encountering some big, hairy \\u201cman-thing\\u201d outside my tent in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere, and alone, was a little more than I wanted to deal with.  I got the dog in the truck and got the hell out of there, with the .357 in my lap.  After a few minutes on the way back down the valley toward an area where I could sleep in peace I sort of had a delayed reaction.  I became unnerved and thought that if I actually see one of these things in the headlights or on the side of the road next to my truck as I passed it I might really lose it.  I was that rattled.  I have lived and backpacked extensively in Montana and in the Canadian Rockies and dealt with the reality of Grizzly bears with no real problem.  But this noise and the creature that most likely made it really freaked me out. After sleeping in the car in the nearest little town of Antonito (I could not find any lodging at 11:30 at night) I went back a little after daybreak to look around and to get ready for another day of fishing.  I ate a cautious breakfast and kept looking around, worried I might actually see one of these things.  But in the daylight I was not quite as unnerved.  I did not find any tracks in the greater area in which I was camping as it was mostly grass, although I did walk around and search for a bit. When I got home I went online and listened to recordings of Mountain Lions and Bobcats, although I know these sounds and have actually seen a Mountain Lion up close in the wild.  The sound was definitely not one of these.  But when I went to this website and listened to some of the recordings I realized it had to be one of these creatures.  This sound was a bit higher in pitch than some of the other recordings, but VERY similar in most other respects. Now I am paranoid and worry that I might not be doing any more backpacking in this beautiful and remote area for fear of running into one of these spooky creatures, especially at night.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Antonito, CO\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"CO 17, but I was in the Conejos Valley just off of FR 250\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"This area is a large series of mountain meadows interspersed with aspen groves and the occasional spruce and fir tree.

It began to snow very hard, almost whiteout conditions at times. Somewhere after Vail and before Eagle the snow stopped for a few minutes. Even though it was night, it was very bright out due to the large moon and all the fresh snow. As I rounded a long curve in the highway my headlights hit two figures walking in the middle of the Colorado River. My first thought was, \\\"Oh no, these people have wrecked in the river and they're trying to cross back to the highway.\\\" I started to pull my Jeep to the side of the road and when I got even with them I saw two fuzzy looking people with very long arms walking down river. I could only see them from the knees up but it was obvious they were human in shape, upright, with elbows and knees. I stopped the car pretty quickly just past them and put on my emergency flashers. There was no break in the snowbank on the side of the road so obviously there was no wreck. With my girlfriend still asleep, I got out and stood on the edge of the bank looking up river for the two figures.

Immediately I heard him coming in from about 100 yards away but not from the direction I expected. He was coming in from just to the left of where I had just walked through. I was surprised he wasn\\u2019t catching my scent. I could here him coming in very quickly through some very thick timber just past the clearing. I had my bow ready and I could see shadows move as he approached but I couldn\\u2019t make out an elk. He stopped in the timber just outside the clearing at 30 yards and then it got super quiet. I didn\\u2019t want to move a muscle so I just sat there motionless for 5 minutes and then blew the cow call again, nothing but silence. I waited another 5 minutes and decided he had blown my cover and left silently. I noticed it was 7:15. I got up and walked over to the wallow and I remember thinking that I had never seen an elk wallow look anything like this before. It looked like a tub made by man. It was perfectly rectangular, about 10 feet long and 4 feet wide and about a foot deep and appeared that the mud had been scooped out by hand. The water was perfectly clear so I knew nothing had used it recently. I admired it for a minute and then started hunting up through this hanging valley. I hunted all day up through the valley and to the top of the mountain without seeing any elk or much fresh sign. I started down the mountain thinking I really wanted to find that wallow again not so much to hunt today but to have a better sense of how to find it in the future.  At about 4:00 I knew I was getting close but I was exhausted from battling the timber all day. Then I stumbled upon another wallow that was also very strange. This one was round and about 7-8 feet in diameter, quite deep with the mud walls scooped up like a mini volcano cone. I remember getting a very weird feeling while looking at this wallow. How could an elk roll in the mud and create this perfectly round hole in the ground? This one had been used very recently because the water was very muddy and there was fresh mud all over the surrounding brush and trees. I started waking down the hill towards the first wallow and realized I was on a heavily traveled game trail, I followed it down the hill about 300 yards and it dropped me into the clearing from the morning. I walked over to the first wallow once again admiring how handmade it looked. I took one step away from the wallow towards the direction that I had entered the area that morning and started to hear a knocking sound. At first I really didn\\u2019t pay attention but then I realized that it wasn\\u2019t timed with the breeze and not consistent. I stopped the sound stopped. I took a step and knock, knock. I took a couple more steps and knock, knock, and knock much louder. Ok now the hairs are standing up on my neck as I realize the knocking is directly timed with my movements. The sound is coming from inside the swampy thicket area about 60 yards from the edge of the clearing. I get to the edge and stop the sound stops. I take a step to the right and knock, knock. A few steps to the left and knock, knock ,knock very loud this time. So know I think there must be a bow hunter in a tree stand in there who is messing with me and I\\u2019m starting to get mad. I decide to take off my backpack and sneak in there where the knocks are coming from as quietly as a seasoned bow hunter can. I notice that as soon as I enter the brush I no longer hear any knocking. I keep sneaking in and finally get to where the sound was coming from and nothing. I search the area high and low looking in every tree for a tree stand and nothing. Now I\\u2019m really mad and go crashing out of there the way I came in. I get back to the clearing and swing my pack onto my back and knock, knock, knock, knock very hard coming from right where I was just standing a couple of minutes ago. Now I\\u2019m totally freaked out. I grab my binoculars and start glassing through the brush and timber looking for a window that I could see through. I take a couple steps to my right while looking through the binoculars and I see a log swing through the air and hit a dead tree, Knock. I quickly try to focus on the spot when it comes into focus in a small sight window through the brush. I can see a large grayish black hairy figure, I see its torso, arm, shoulder, elbow and hand clutching a log about 4\\u201d in diameter and smacking it against a dead tree, knock, knock. I move to try and get a better look but it moves from the window but as it does I distinctly see its movement. It was a very human like move as it turned I could see it turn at the hips while its arm swung in time with the movement just like a person would look while walking and turning 90 degrees. Realize I am looking through binoculars at 60 yards so all of this is crystal clear. It was totally covered with hair about 3 to 4 inches long and appeared to be matted with mud. I judge that its elbow was at least 5 feet off the ground. Almost going into complete panic now I start running the other way. I only take a few steps and force myself to calm down. I tell myself that if that animal wanted to harm me it would have already done it. So I start walking diagonally away from it in a direction that will get me off of this shelf. The knocking continues intermittently as I put yards between us, when I get about 150 yards away I hear what I can only describe as the sound of a log flying through the air crashing through the brush and hitting the ground with a thud at about 50 yards from me. I never heard any more sound but as I worked my way down through the dark timber I found myself on a heavy game trail and I came on a switch back where a tree had fallen or been pushed over. As I approached I could see and smell this rancid black liquid on the ground where the tree used to stand. I can only describe it as a huge puddle of pitch black diarrhea buzzing with flies. There did not appear to be anything in it like chokecherry seeds or hair or bone that you would associate with bear shit. I see lots of bear sign and this certainly didn\\u2019t appear to be bear. I got off of that slope as quickly as possible without further incident. It was an hour and a half back to camp. I arrived in camp disappointed to find that all 3 of my hunting partners had already left. It was a long semi sleepless night in the tent with my pistol by my side but uneventful.

Two of my goats are experienced packers and two were new.  After several shorter treks I had gone to Spring Creek Pass where I planned to walk part of the Colorado Trail -- possibly down to Durango -- then resupply and go back to the Wemineuch.  After reaching one of the local creeks one of my goats started getting sick so I decided to head back toward the truck and bide my time while I assessed his situation.  There were tons of people on the trail last summmer and I wanted to be alone so I went off near Jarosa Mesa and found a meadow surrounded by thick forest where I didn't feel I'd encounter anyone.  We stayed two days. During that time the dogs and particularly the goats were periodically nervous, then they would calm. Goats point to what they see or hear but whenever I would look I would not see anything. I checked the area thinking there might be bear or mountain lion nearby but didn't find signs that would indicate a den and although there was bear scat in the area it was not fresh.  Still, this was a time of drought that had the bears hungry all over the state and they were having bear problems down in Lake City right then so, especially with a sick goat, I stayed alert to the possibility.  Especially since I was also near one of the only water sources. In the meantime I was doctoring my goat and working with the others. At one point when I was playing tug-of-war and growling with my dogs (an older border collie and a border collie pup) the goats alarmed and bunched around us pointing at the woods but when I checked I couldn't see anything and the dogs didn't react.  I periodically got the feeling we were being watched, then it would pass. The puppy occasionally got interested in something in the woods but would come back. When I work with the goats, I sing a lot.  They have also developed a fondness for the pennywhistle so I had spent a lot of time in the afternoon just playing music with all of us sprawled around the meadow together. The meadow was rich in smells but aside from the plant smells from walking around there was more a musky elk smell than anything.  Lots of signs of deer and elk in the area.  At dusk the animals got extremely nervous. I had just gone inside my tent to get something, both dogs were inside with me and the goats just outside.  I suddenly heard this alarm vocalization unlike anything I've ever heard from my animals, but easily could have been.  Under the circumstances I could easily have made vocalizations I had never made before. The goats were beside the tent and whatever it was was right behind the tent. I knew it was something big because my dog will tear after a lesser beast barking but the only times I've encountered a bear or a mountain lion with him he stays right with me and gives a quiet growl that says, \\\"This is serious.\\\"   I grabbed my pepper spray fearing it was a bear and started out of the tent, turning as I crouched out the door and yelling (don't ask me why) at the dogs to stay inside. The goats were beside the tent pointed at the back.  There it was. A bigfoot. I couldn't see its whole body because it was blocked by the tent but if it was a female the breasts weren't prominent.  It had medium chestnut fur, was standing erect on two legs, probably 8 feet tall (I have a brother who is 6'7\\\" and a nephew who is 6'10\\\" and growing so I have some perspective), and probably only 12 feet away staring straight at me.  The face had fur -- less around the eyes but not as bare as your sketch -- and the eyes were all brown -- no whites. Like a deer's eyes.  Its arms were hanging at its sides. Everything was totally silent. My dogs were beside me but we were all frozen in place.  I know that if anything threatened me one of my dogs would die defending me.  On an instinctive level I was as terrified as I've ever been but even at the time I knew I didn't feel threatened.  I wouldn't have dreamed of using the pepper unless it had attacked.  In retrospect I thought it was interesting that I didn't have (at least under those circumstances) fight/flight instincts. I simply froze in place.  Perhaps if it had done anything menacing I would have reacted differently.  But I felt simultaneously terrified (instinctively) and amazed.  Before that moment I had never even known if I believed in bigfoot or not.  Had I thought about it I would have assumed it would be something to ponder in the Pacific Northwest, but certainly not in Colorado.  Had never once, for all the thought I've put into \\\"what would happen if I encountered...\\\" thought of the possibility of encountering one and was totally unprepared for and in awe of it. It seemed unhurried.  We stared at each other for what felt like a long time, then it made a low rumbling sound and turned its head and I caught just a glimpse of another back behind it.  It looked back at me, then they turned and loped off out of sight.  I could feel the vibrations in the ground. I got the feeling that nothing in the encounter was threatening to me or the goats.  That they were curious. There was a slight breeze and I was upwind (somehow I doubt that was accidental) so I didn't notice a particularly strong smell.  I think I had felt the vibration as it/they approached but thought it was the goats.  During the entire encounter from the vocalization on, except for the breeze, it was totally silent and the sound (birds etc) resumed a few minutes later. We all slept very peacefully that night. I found no tracks but the ground was so dry and hard I couldn't make a very good track when I tried. The next morning I packed up and left more because I felt like I was intruding in someone else's space than feeling danger.  I felt like I was being watched and gauged from the animals that they did too. My older dog stayed right beside me, alert and ready to act.  The puppy seemed unphased by it all.   The puppy had come back at one point earlier in the day having rolled in what I thought was human manure...now I'm not so sure.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Lake City\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"CO 149\", \"COUNTY\": \"Hinsdale County\", \"DATE\": \"5th\", \"SEASON\": \"Summer\", \"MONTH\": \"August\", \"YEAR\": \"2000\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"Near Jarosa Mesa down toward Rambouillet Park.\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"Dusk, but still in good light.

In the past few days, we were just driving through SW Colorado, driving through areas we had not seen before. We had driven over Spring Creek Pass (going South).  We drove West on a dirt road, into a high valley with a stream.  We parked during sunset/moonrise, just off the road and near the stream (a pullout-type area).  My boyfriend wanted to get some fishing in before it got too dark.  So we quickly started to get a quick dinner together (soup) and get our gear ready for the night.  We were not going to put up the tent, but instead took some gear out of the truck bed (truck has a topper) and we were going to sleep in it.  We were moving pretty quick to get this stuff done so he could fish, so I guess we weren't paying much attention to other stuff.  We did stop to take a few pictures of the rising moon. He went over to the stream to fish, and I started to eat my soup in my camp chair.  The bushes near the stream were very tall and thick, and I couldn't see my boyfriend at all.  There were more bushes on the other side of the truck (between the main road and truck).  I was just eating my soup, when I heard loud crashing through these bushes (between the road and truck).  It sounded like something very big with very long legs stepping through the brush, and it was coming right towards the truck.  The brush came very close to the truck (less than 10 ft). At first, I thought this might a moose.  (We had seen moose in the Northern Colorado mtns earlier in the spring, and we had seen a sign posted near the road warning a moose had been seen in the area (\\\"Hunters, be sure of your target...\\\").  So, I first thought this could be a moose.  It was definitely very big and had long legs (much bigger than an elk, and not a bear).  (We have also seen bear in Colorado, so I've seen the size/movement of bear.) The last thing I wanted was a big moose (or anything else) to step out of that brush (and on me)!  I was very scared.  I quickly made room in the front seat, which were now filled with gear, and started honking the horn.  I wanted it to know I was there (because it sounded like it was going to pop out of there pretty quick).  The crashing continued but seemed to move off a bit.  Then it stopped.  I couldn't be sure if it had completely moved away or just stopped.  My concern was also for my boyfriend.  I didn't want a moose to come across him in the bushes by the creek.  My boyfriend heard the honking, and I could hear him coming back.  The bushes were very thick and he was swearing, struggling.  He returned, I explained the situation.  Irritated and with fishing pole in hand, he walked up to and down the road a short ways and didn't see anything. If it were a moose we felt we would have seen it (he from the higher road or I would have seen it crossing the pullout to the stream).  My boyfriend would have been able to see if a moose was in/near the bushes near the truck, from that higher position.  At this point I heard very low growling, faint (very deep, very low).  It seemed to come from the tree line across the road and part way up the hill.  It was brief (seemed like 4 growls), and over by the time my boyfriend came back.  I didn't tell him at that point, because it didn't make sense, and I didn't want him getting irritated for my being spooked. He went back to the creek.  I sat in the truck and ate my soup, window half down to listen.  I heard more noise from the same area as before, this time loud splooshing and splashing (there was a drainage with water that was coming down from the hill to meet the creek).  The noise was very loud and distinctive, not at all like natural water sounds.  It sounded like something big splooshing in the water. My boyfriend came back, saying it was getting too dark to fish.  He sat in the truck with me and ate.  I started to tell him about the splooshing (which stopped when he came back) and the growling from earlier.  He was disturbed and said we should leave. We both knew it wasn't a moose.  We felt he would have seen it from the road.  We also knew a moose would have not have just hung around making more noise once it knew we were there.  I thought it was too big to be an elk/deer/bear.  We felt something was still there and we couldn't see it. We quickly put all the stuff in the truck and drove off. I was surprised that he was so scared, very unusual for him.  He finally told me that he had found big footprints by the stream, in the mud.  He said they were huge, much bigger than his print, and much deeper (the thing would have to have a large foot and be extremely heavy).  He had seen other tracks by the stream, from other animals and from a person earlier in the day (sneaker-type print).  He said no man could have made those bigger tracks.  He said the tracks also went into deeper brush.  When he was working his way back to the truck, he would try to follow these tracks out, but would only end up in deeper brush (thats why he was swearing). He said he was wondering at the time, \\\"Where is this idiot going?  Why is he going into the brush?\\\".  He thought there were tracks from more than one, at least two, and from that day. I asked him, why didn't he say something the first time when he came back. He admitted it took some time to process.  He also said that it felt like something was in there with him, in the brush. He said it took him time to put everything together, the crashing, the growling, the thing not leaving, the giant footprints, the uneasiness.  We both concluded it was likely a bigfoot.  Giant footprints like that are hard to argue with. The noises were made from a big animal , but he didn't see anything from the road.  My boyfriend said these things must have been intelligent.  They seemed to be watching/waiting/hiding.  They knew when he walked away and came back. When we drove away from the pullout, I had a good look at the brush between the road and truck, and it amazed me how small an area it was.  If something big was in there, and it didn't leave, it would really have to hide in there. I've always believed in bigfoots, but my boyfriend has always been skeptical (even despite the visual sightings by his step-dad, his friend, and his own odd experiences).  But he thinks it was a bigfoot.  I wish I had seen the tracks, but there was no way! Also, I don't think I've ever seen my boyfriend that scared.  He just kept driving.

It was late June and I was on a fishing trip to several lakes and beaver ponds in the area.  I was supposed to be taking a friend along, but he had to cancel at the last minute. I left my camp at Dumont Lake in the morning and headed up the four wheel drive road to the trailhead that leads to Fish Hook Lake and Lost Lake. It is usually possible to drive the three miles to the trailhead, but the road was closed by the Forest Service due to lingering snow drifts, so I had to hike the road. I arrived at Fishook Lake in the late morning and spent a couple of hours fishing and eating lunch.  About 1:30 I left that lake and began to hike to Lost Lake which is only a few hundred yards to the northeast. The trail I was on kind of funnels into the lake, and as the lake came into view I noticed a large, dark  animal about 20 yards to my right near a boulder.  My first thought was that I had suprised a bear, so I froze and waited to see what the animal would do.  It was soon obvious that this animal was not a bear or any other animal I had ever seen.  The animal was standing on two legs and was slightly crouched, it appeared to be staring across the lake.  When it saw me, it fully crouched next to the boulder with its left hand resting on the rock. What I saw is best described as a large, hairy bipedal animal that had features of both a man and an ape. The animal was covered with shiny, dark hair that was approximately 3-4\\\" long and was somewhat shorter in the face area.  The animal was huge and the arms appeared very long as opposed to a person's.  The head was somewhat dome-shaped and was set on massive shoulders, the neck appeared very short.  The animal's eyes appeared below a slightly sloping forehead and there may have been a brow ridge.  The eyes were dark and the nose was flat and wide.  The face was dark and the lips appeared thin. I never saw the animal open its mouth or display teeth. After the animal crouched, it again looked over the lake then back at me.  The animal then stood up and to my relief pivoted away from me and began to walk away from me at an angle.  I moved forward to get a better look and the animal must have heard me move because it began to move quicker and glanced back at me.  The animal walked briskly into the trees and I heard it moving for a couple more seconds then it was out of earshot.  The whole event lasted between 8 and 12 seconds. I realized at this time that this must be the bigfoot of legend, but I had thought that they lived in the Pacific Northwest and were probably a myth, I certainly had never heard any reports of sightings in Colorado.  I briefly thought about following the animal or looking for some good footprints to show the appropriate authorities, but I was alone and the animal was big, I would conservatively guess it was around 7 feet tall and weighed over 300 pounds, so I left and hiked quickly out of the area, not slowing down until I got to my truck. After getting back to camp, I debated about what to do and finally decided the potential ridicule if I reported this to someone and the animal was not found was not worth it.  I watched the media for any unusual reports of bigfoot-type animals in Colorado in the months and years after my sighting and a few reports did indeed trickle in.  I got on the internet to further research the subject and eventually spoke with a BFRO researcher about my encounter and he urged me to submit a report.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Steamboat Springs\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Highway 40\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"High mountain lake surrounded by trees and some rock formations.

It was a parcel of Colorado state forest service land that had just recently been opened to hunting. It was aprox. 8:00am and we were moving north through the trees on the east side of a fairly large clear cut. It had just snowed that morning, so our movements were fairly quiet. I was using a diaphram call trying to imitate a cow elk in estrus (a series of higher pitched squeals and mews). As we were moving along I was warching off to our west to see if I could spot any movement in the aspen on the uphill slope on the west side of the clear cut. It was then that I saw movement, a large figure stood up from a short bit of growth. At first I thought that it might be another hunter, but as I looked closer I could see no weapon that it could be hunting with and the size seemed to be to large for a person. I stopped movnig at that point and watched it, it stood and looked in our direction for about 30 seconds and then turned and started walking up into the dense stand of aspen on the hillside. The thing that really sticks in my mind is the way that it swung its whole upper body as it turned to leave, it is almost like it used the momentum from the turning of its upper body to make its whole body turn to leave. At that point I mentioned it to my partner and all he said was that it was probably another hunter, I might mention that he is the type of person that does not believe that anyting out of the ordinary might actually exist. It was only after I mentioned it to him that I raised the binoculars that were hanging around my neck and scanned the hillside for anymore signs of movement. I scanned the hillside for about five minutes and was unable to pick up any movement. We never checked the far side of the meadow where I first saw it because my partner was worried that if we broke out of the trees that we might spook any game that might be in the area. Also because he believed that it was another hunter he did not wish to investigate the area that I had seen it. All I know is that what ever I saw was not a person and was not a bear (I have seen those go up on two legs before), I only know that I am not sure what it was I saw. It was a year or two later and my wife and I were looking at a bigfoot page on the net and found recordings of what is believed to be a bigfoot. When we heard it she mentioned that the sound I make on the call when hunting sounds very similar to the sound that was recorded. I don't if this could have contributed to seeing what I saw or not, maybe it was trying to figure out what we were.

Her kids were sleeping and she was just getting into bed. My two dogs were barking outside, so I decided to take them for a walk since I figured they wanted me to take them out of the cage to do their business. I went to the backyard and opened the cage, but before I let them out, I placed the leash on their necks so they wouldn't run around and make trouble. They were barking more then usual, like when company arrives in the drive way, but there was no one.  I went to the front of the house and got to the street. I noticed that the bushes in front of the neighbor's house were moving and thought it may be a deer. As I kept walking I looked back to the bushes with curiousity and I noticed a figure walking from the bushes towards the back of the neighbor's house. Their entire front and back yard was lit due a full moon and I could see a human shape going towards the back slowly, almost like hiding. It was weird because I could see the reflection of the moon on its entire body, as if it was wearing something that reflected the light very well. I turned around with the dogs and went down the hill towards the end of the street. I kept looking to the left since I knew that whatever I saw (if it wasn't human) had to cross an opening across the other neighbor's front yard to escape into the woods. As I approched the mailbox of the last house of the dead end, I kept looking to the house on the left, their driveway went up hill. The full moon illuminated the driveway very well. I stopped and waited about a minute. The dogs started barking even more. Then I saw something running on two legs across and the dogs wanted to go after it, the chain almost slipped from my hands and they were pulling so hard. The thing ran across and went into the trees. The entire body had what appeared to be hair all over. I couldn't tell  whether the fur was dark gray or brown. I'm leaning more to brown. But everything else was as clear as day. I then thought to myself, if it was a thief dressed in a monkey suit going from yard to yard thru people's properties why then wasn't he smart enough to wait until I left with my dogs to run across? And if it was a practical joke from someone, that guy must had really had to have guts of steel to listen to mad barking dogs and still run. Besides, it's a crime to traspass thru multiple houses' yards, specially so late at night just for a joke. I told my sister the next day about it, she remembered the unusual loud barkings of the dogs and she confessed she felt a little concerned about it. I'm glad she believed me.

It was walking towards us, slowly, but fast enough that it made no break in the sound produced as it walked through the leaves. I said,\\\"Hey, who's there?

I was about 12/13 years of age.  I have held this incident in my mind's eye all these years and have tried to figure out what I had seen.  After reading sightings and descriptions on your website, I beleive what I saw could well have been a sasquatch. It was summer time and I was riding my horse, Jenny.  We were going to visit a neighbor.  I was on my regular path through the woods when I saw a lone, large, dark figure.  At first I thought it was a man making \\\"cat faces\\\" on the pine trees.  There were a lot of trees in that area  that were being used to collect resin.  It looked as if the man had on a raincoat.  That seemed very strange to me as it was a clear and hot day.  And then when I looked closer, it looked like a fur coat and that really made no sense because it was summer and very warm.  The \\\"person\\\" was a distance from me and I hesitate to even try and say how far.  As I was scrutinizing this \\\"person\\\", Jenny suddenly stopped and threw her ears forward and raised her head.  She, too, had seen the \\\"man\\\".  I urged her to go forward by kicking her in her sides, but she refused to move.  I decided to turn her around and go another direction in order to make her think we were not interested in the \\\"man\\\".  She gladly went in the oposite direction.  When I saw she would go in another direction, I turned her around and again proceeded toward the \\\"man\\\".  Because Jenny sensed a danger, I was uneasy at this point.  She continued to carry me in the direction of the furry man until we approached to spot she had stopped at before.  She again pointed her ears forward, raised her head, smelled the air and refused to move another step. I watched the creature for awhile as I felt I was at a safe distance.  It was at a large pine tree.  It was making up and down motions (like it could have been scratching its back).  The arms seemed to be raised in the air as it made these undulating motions.  I sat there on Jenny trying to figure out if the creature had on a fur coat or a rain coat and if so, what for?  As I mentioned, I have pondered this for years and it finally makes sense to me in the context of a sasquatch sighting.

It was a heavily wooded area that only had about three homes at the time. On the Southeast side of this neighborhood there were no homes at all and was especially a favorite spot of ours to play since it had a few curiosities about the area. Just to describe the location a bit; this wooded area had a nice canopy of trees and was somewhat darkened even in the bright daylight. There was this large mound of eroded dirt that had a patch of sunlight directly coming through the tree canopy. About 15 feet away there was a large drainage ditch that was about five foot across and four foot deep, someone at one time had placed a log across this ditch in order to cross it. On the other side there was an old VW bug and van that had been there so long that small trees were actually growing up and through them. Further back from this was the scarce remnants of a burned down house, we rarely explored back further than this due to the increasing darkness, heavy foliage and swampy ness. On the day this sighting occurred my cousin and myself were playing on the dirt mound with our matchbox cars while my brother explored just a short distance away to the left of us and the VWs. Suddenly we were jolted to the sound of a loud crack as if someone had stepped on a stick; we immediately looked to the direction of the VWs where the sound came from. There approximately 10 feet to the right of them was a large human like figure. I roughly estimate that it was around seven feet tall; its color was not really distinguishable due to the poor lighting. Its right side was slightly obscured by some small trees on the bank of the ditch. We stared at it for about a minute or so and then started conversing with each other wondering who or what this thing was that was just standing there watching us. I remember one of us supposing it was a bear standing up but that was quickly batted down since shoulders were clearly visible, it simply looked like large hairy man. None of us recall seeing a face or any other clear details considering that all that was really visible was a jagged hairy silhouette against the dimly lit woods. At one point I remember saying \\u201cI bet it\\u2019s Bobby (an older teenager that lived in that neighborhood) trying to scare us\\u201d I shouted: \\u201cHey Bobby stop playing around, we know it\\u2019s you!\\u201d\\u2026 but no response. Then one of us yelled out; \\u201cok ok you can come out now, stop trying to scare us whoever you are\\u201d\\u2026 again no response. As we continued to stare it slowly moved slightly to its left fully exposing itself from behind that small clump of trees, as it moved it raised its left hand up and outwards in order to grab a tree branch while at the same time leaning forward as if to get a better look at us, my brother said that when it did this that from his particular angle he could see long hair dangling from its arm.

We were about 50 or 60 yards from the end of the road, where a large opening sits. I had briefly stopped to tie my shoe. Suddenly, we heard crashing sounds, like footsteps only louder. There were 5 or 6 steps, and as we turned to look at what was making the noise, two trees parted as if giant hands were just brushing them aside. Sadly, we were both too scared to stay around any longer. We ran all the way around S.S.M.S. and around the Elementary school. Cut through the catwalk. And, ran the rest of the way home.

She said she had heard these large sounds, almost like foot steps, except she said that they covered far too much ground. She said she had heard four or five steps then the sound of wood breaking. And then a large thrashing sound as though it were shaking large bushes together. The next day my mother, myself and our neighbors went out into the woods to investigate. We found a large branch approximately 10 inches around. Had been torn from a tree. And I do mean torn, this wasn't a cut or a branch that had been struck by lightning. This had been ripped from the tree.

I heard a very loud noise coming from the backyard of our next door neighbor\\u2019s that startled me.  I quickly dismissed it as the sound of a sprinkler hitting our aluminum fence.  It was a metallic, chatter sound.  It lasted about the duration of what might be the rotation of about 180 degrees of a sprinkler head.  But then the sound abruptly stopped, and I could tell that neither our sprinklers nor our neighbors where on at the time.  Several seconds later, I heard the same chilling noise but I could tell that the source was now about 200 feet away.  I immediately felt frightened and went quickly back inside the house.  It really spooked me at the time, but I hadn\\u2019t thought about the incident again until I heard a similar recording on your website, specifically the 1973 Whoop-Howl from Puyallop, Washington.

The sound of the bobcat from the National Geographic sight also sounded somewhat metallic-like, so that may be another possible explanation.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"On Monday, June 30, 2008, between 5:00 a.m. and 5:15 a.m., I had the experience of hearing a chilling and unexplained sound.  I was taking numerous boxes and garbage bags from the garage to the end of my driveway at the street for trash pickup.  I had made approximately 6 trips back and forth when, after laying a box down at the curb, I heard something that made me stop in my tracks.  I experienced what I first thought was the start of a loud siren, a loud and ascending WHOOOOO\\u2026, coming from across the street.  The sound came from a tree line about 200 feet away at the edge of Horseshoe Lake.  There are empty grated lots directly across the street from my house (about 125 feet deep) and then approximately another 25 feet or more of dense palmetto scrub and primarily pines and loblolly bay trees down to the lake shore.  The sound continued to ascend in pitch and when the pitch didn\\u2019t change like that of a siren and I realized that a siren would not be coming from that direction, but rather from the highway behind our house, I felt somewhat panicked.  The sound ended in a booming \\u2013OOP.  The entire whoop was long in duration and went from a low to high pitch.  It seemed to be aimed directly towards me and was extremely far carrying in tone.  I immediately felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  When my brain could not place the sound with any animal or bird that I am familiar with, I became very frightened at thinking that a man was watching me and calling out.  I started to take some steps backward towards the garage in anticipation that I would see something moving towards me across the empty lot.  Within seconds of the WHOOP, an owl called out with a common hooting from the top of a tree in that same area, as if it had been startled.  The owl\\u2019s voice was very distinct from the other sound in the loudness and the way it carried, as well as the elevation of the source of the sound.  I went back into the garage and waited for about 5 minutes there to listen for any other sounds, but only heard the frogs that are common at that time.  Although still dark, there were clear skies at the time, and I could see the silhouette of the tree line.  My side of the street was dimly lit by the lights in the garage and street lights a short distance away.  I go out at this time every morning to haul trash and to take my dog for a quick walk out to the mailbox, and I am used to hearing numerous types of frogs, owls, and whippoorwills. As I stood there, logic told me that even a large man could not have made the resonating sound that I heard from that distance away. Over the next few days, I told my family members what I had heard and asked if they knew of an animal or bird that made such a sound, but they didn\\u2019t.  The sound I heard was so unusual, that I couldn\\u2019t dismiss it.  I felt the need to keep trying to satisfy the mystery of the sound by placing a native bird or animal to it.  I read every voice description of Florida bird species entries in my North American bird book, paying closed attention to all owls, loons, cranes, egrets, herons and hawks, that I thought may be large enough to have such a bellowing voice.  None of the voices were described as \\u201cwhoops.\\u201d  I then went online and searched for \\u201cbird sound whoop\\u201d and \\u201canimal sound whoop.\\u201d  I spent quite a bit of time on National Geographic\\u2019s website listening to voice recordings of numerous birds from this area as well as bobcats, coyotes, foxes, etc.  Nothing seemed to match.  I then started to notice the many links to the BFRO website as well as a link to a video of our local Channel 13 newscast of an expedition that BFRO had in the Tampa area about a year ago.  When I played the news clip, and heard one of the female researchers make a call out like a whoop, I almost felt relieved, like I knew in my heart that I was on the right track.  The sound I heard was very similar to the call she made, although the whoop I heard was of a longer duration.  After seeing the news clip, I felt more comfortable about researching the information on the BRFO website.  I came across the sound recordings, and after listening to several, I became convinced that what I heard matched more closely to some of the Skunk Ape recordings than to any other animal or bird known in this area.  I decided to call your organization to discuss what I had experienced. Below are the most similar recordings I found on the website as compared to the sound that I heard: 1974 Whoops and Knocks from California (although I heard only one \\u201cwhoop\\u201d and it was of longer duration) The \\u201cFlorida Howl\\u201d and the 1994 Moaning Howl from Columbiana County, Ohio (the howls in this clip start off like the siren-like beginning of the whoop I heard, but these then descend in pitch as opposed to the one I heard which continued to ascend until ending in a \\u2013OOP)\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Oviedo\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"CR-419\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"The sound came from a tree line surrounding the lake.

The conservation areas are dense forests, made up of palmetto scrub, pines, loblolly bays, Florida maples, and oaks.

I had gone outside on the porch to have a cigarette about 9:00 pm and my two German Sherpards went out with me. I was outside about 2 -3 mins. when less then 100 feet from me just at the woods edge I heard a very loud yell/scream. My two dogs immediately jumped off the porch and took off towards the sound and I ran inside to get a shotgun and light. The dogs where running around sniffing the ground frantically but staying in the yard and not going into the wood. With my flashlight in one hand and gun in the other I went out into the yard and was looking around for a clue as to what could have made such a weird loud noise. Even though we live in the country we do have a few houses around us and the only thing that I could come up with is that it had to be some kid messing around and at that time I became mad and yelled \\\" you might think messing around here playing games is fun but I'll tell you I have a gun and someone could very well get hurt messing around like this in the dark\\\". I had barely gotten the words out of my mouth when I would say about 25 yards into the woods came the scream again. The dogs dashed into the woods and even though they normally obey me very well, all of the yelling would not get them to return to the yard for about 5 mins. Two things stand out as very odd about what happened tonight. One is that it was right in my yard, granted it was at the edge but it was in the yard none the less. It made such a loud yell as though it wanted me to know that it was there! The other thing I find strange is that the dogs never once barked or growled. You would have to know my dogs to understand how strange that is. They are very protective of the yard. They will bark at a leaf blowing though, and if anyone comes up the drive, watch out! They love to hear themselves bark. They did not bark once, they just kept running around as though they had gone nuts. My wife was in the living room and heard it.  It was loud enough to hear it with the windows closed and the TV on.

There was one hog killed in that area earlier in the day.  The Game Wardens patrol this WMA heavily due to the popularity and crowds that show up for hog hunts.  They clear the area before leaving each night and did so this night.  They left us with the biologist as the last ones in the area.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"I have not heard of any other incidents.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"Last year my brother and I were hog hunting in the Guana River WMA in St Johns County, FL.  There was a lot of activity in the woods that day as this place gets crowded during hog hunts.  We were the last hunters to leave and we were talking to the check station attendant (biologist).  It was about an hour after dark and it was starting to get cold.  There was only a propane heater and latern running at the check station.  The Game Wardens had cleared the WMA of all vehicles, so we know that we were the only ones left in the area. To get into the WMA, you must drive through a wooded portion of a state park (no hunting allowed).  The check station is about 300 yards past the entrance gate. As we were getting ready to leave, we heard a very loud screaming (several screams over a 6-7 second period) about 75 to 100 yards behind the check station back towards a marshy area that borders the state park and WMA.  These screams were high pitched and very powerful, and they seemed to go right through you.  It sounded as though there was someone getting attacked by something.  It made the hair on the back of our necks stand up.  The air was very calm and cool.  We could also hear the faint sound of something in the woods moving palmettos and bushes (lasted about 3 or 4 seconds). At first we thought it might have been a bird in the marsh, but this sound was way too loud and the even though it was high pitched, it was very dynamic as though a very large animal had made it.  The sound was closer than the marsh, and we heard the noises of something moving in the woods.  It sounded very similar to some the recorded sounds I have heard on this site.  We asked the biologist what he thought it was and he did not know.  For several minutes we pondered the idea that it was a bobcat/panther, hog, bird, of some sort of small game getting attacked such as a rabbit squeel, but we all concurred that it was none of those.  My brother and I have been hunting/camping all of our lives and know different animal sounds.  It freaked us out pretty bad and we left after hearing this.  I was especially freaked out by the response of the biologist who did not stick around. Normally I would have just ignored this incident and passed it off as some animal as mentioned before, but I know that it was not.  It also brought back the memory of a very similar sound we heard years ago (84-86?) in Pennsylvania while camping on a vaction trip (rural area of Lancaster County).  It was just after dark as we returned back to our camper (grandparents motorhome) from the camp ground fishing pond.  As we arrived, we heard the same type of sound off in the distance.  It scared us to death and we did not leave the camper all night. We urged our grandparents to travel to our next camp ground the next day.

One night in early to mid-December my partner and I were sitting on our lanai (as we do nightly).  It was about 10:00 p.m. or so.  Suddenly the quiet was broken by a loud cry which sounded like it was coming from close to the street.  We looked at each other and asked each other jokingly, \\u201cIs that Bigfoot?\\u201d  It did not sound like any human we had ever heard. We listened and no more sounds.  The next night, I was sitting on the lanai, my partner had not yet come out, about 9:00 p.m.  I stopped the sound on my computer and just then I heard, distinctly, two rocks clack together at the end of my short backyard, close to where my neighbor to the left and I share a property line close.  There are tall, 6-7 foot, plants at the end of my property. I sat there for maybe 15 minutes listening and heard nothing more.  A few days later, for two days, my partner and I came out and smelled a strange, unknown, odor.  My dog didn\\u2019t make any noise but sniffed the air.   It wasn\\u2019t a bad odor, just unusual.  A few days later, I was again sitting on the lanai, about 11:00 p.m. and to my left I heard a stone hit the side of my home which made it vibrate.  I sat quietly for a few minutes and went back to my business.  An hour later, when I got ready to go inside, I heard what sounded like 4-5 pebbles hitting the side of the lanai where I was standing.  About 3 nights ago, my partner and I were sitting on the lanai again, this time it was lightly raining.  It was about 11:30 p.m.  Suddenly we heard a barrage of pebbles hit the side of the lanai.   My partner said, those were stones.  I was unsure if it could have been the rain.  A few moments later, another barrage of pebbles hit our lanai.  My dog got up and looked.  It was not the gentle rain we were hearing.  After the second time, we didn\\u2019t hear anything else.  I don\\u2019t know if this is even possible to be bothered by a Bigfoot in The Villages.

I used to take walks in the afternoons when I would get off of work. There was an old logging road that made a loop about 3 miles around in the woods across from my house. It was about 3 thirty or so when I set off this day. I always carried a little 22 pistol with me in case I came across any snakes. My grandmothers two dogs also always went with me on these walks. We had turned off the main grade and gone maybe a quarter of a mile into the woods when we started down through the slough. The logging road cut between to little swamps. There was alot of scrub oaks and low growing trees just before it opened up into the swamps. I had just cleared the scrub oaks and came into the clearing when I noticed the change. It was like everything in the woods had vanished. The birds stopped singing, I mean it was quiet. I broke out in a cold sweet and the hair on the back of my neck stood up like I had just been shot. Like when you know you are being watched. I glanced down at the dogs and both of them had come to a stop like they were frozen in place. The hair on both of them was standing straight up. They were looking off to the right of me but neither one of them so much as growled. It may sound funny but it seemed like on cue the wind picked up and I caught a smell that I really cant describe. I looked to my right, and about fifty or sixty yards up the hill I could make out the shape of something very big , standing between a couple of oak trees, and some other brush. I stood there for about thirty seconds or so trying to figure out what it was before it moved. It reached out and grabbed two of the oak trees and started shaking them back and forth. Then I heard something like I have never heard before in my life. It didnt sound like an animal growling or a person screaming, but kind of a mix of both. The next thing I knew I had reached for my pistol, looked down and both dogs were gone. I decide that it was time for me to leave at that point and made my way very quickly back to the house. The next encounter happened about 5 days later on the other side of the main grade. I had just left the house from having lunch and going back to work. I was riding a four wheeler at the time and we had a lot of trails cut out through the woods that we rode on. I had just come out of the woods and onto a pig trail just up from what we called bathtub springs. The pig trail turns into a main grade about a quarter of a mile from where I came out on it. I started towards the main grade when I noticed something very large and brown running through the woods about 20 to 25 yards to my left. It kept up with me as I rode about 15 mph, for at least 20 seconds. I saw it sling something in a side ways motion, like throwing a frisbee. I was just about to the main grade when I realized something had hit me in the chest. I didn't stop until I got out to the main paved road. When I did stop to see what had hit me, I saw that it was a rabbit that had been turned inside out. It was several years before I worked up the courage to go back into those woods. A lot of people may not believe me, but those that know me, know that I grew up in those woods hunting, trapping, fishing, and camping out.

It was about 1:15 AM. There were four of us in an older model Monte Carlo pulling a Coleman travel trailer loaded with cave diving gear, (probably weighing in around eight-hundred pounds gross). A Tennessee State Trooper was driving and I was shotgun. The two men in the back were asleep. Suddenly, right out of nowhere, (with only our headlights for illumination), a tall, huge \\u201cblack form\\u201d rushed from the right edge of the roadway and came toward us, (in a perpendicular path as if to cross the highway). It was so quick that the driver had no reaction time whatsoever! While the car missed this erect, but stooped, huge black form the trailer obviously got it. The trailer sounded as if it had exploded and I saw, in the glow of our brake lights, that the entire trailer became airborne and went about as high as the roof of the car! \\u201cWhat did we hit?\\u201d was the question yelled by the sleepy owner. The other sleepy passenger yelled, \\u201cWhat the hell?\\u201d The trooper calmly looked over at me and in an astounded voice asked, \\u201cWhat the hell was that? Did you see that?\\u201d I replied quietly, \\u201cI saw that and I have no idea what that was!\\u201d The owner asked from the back seat, \\u201cWas it a bear? I\\u2019ll bet it was a bear!\\u201d The trooper, in total agreement with me replied, \\u201cI don\\u2019t think so. It was too big!\\u201d Well, all the while we had been braking to a stop. We all got out, checked out the trailer, checked the passenger side of the car, looked for a corpse, looked for blood, looked for hair, but found nothing at all! The best I remember we even turned around and drove back past the point of impact but saw nothing! It will be passed off as a bear, (I am certain), but I do not believe a bear could possibly be that big, move that fast, or suffer that kind of impact without being injured.

I convinced myself and my friend that whatever it may be, its more afraid of us than we were of it. A while later, maybe 20 minutes or so, he mentioned that it was still there starring at us.

It apparently wasn't too concerned b/c it didn't so much as blink or move. We again convinced ourselves that it was nothing to be afraid of. We continued with fishing and not long after my friend noticed that it had finally moved on. We thought nothing more of it until I got the biggest scare of my adult life.

Without a second thought or a spoken word, we dropped our fishing poles and ran as fast as we could to the truck. We jumped in and locked up tight. My first question was if he had heard it and his response was \\\"yes, what was that?\\\" We were so scared that we weren't sure what to do. The decision was made a couple of minutes later to start the truck and turn on the headlights. He raced the engine and blew the horn repeatedly. Even after a few minutes of doing this and feeling sure that whatever is was had to have left the area, we were still VERY hesitant to retrieve our fishing gear.

I was playing near a window in a second story farm house when something caught my eye. I watched as a hairy nine-foot creature walked up hill across the front yard. It had a huge stride, as if it were in a hurry. It kept looking back as it walked with its long swinging arms. When it turned its head it had to also turn its shoulders to be able to look at a 90-degree angle. I stood watching it walk along when it apeared to look up and make eye contact with me for only a second. It never broke its stride. It's eyes glowed like a raccoon or a cat at night when light is shined in their eyes. What frightened me was that it was still daylight. I didn't get really freaked until it disapeared around the side of the house. That's when I ran in to the kitchen were my parents were playing cards with another couple. I tried to get their attention but they didn't have time for a whiny kid who wanted a cookie or candy. It wasn't until they escorted me out the front door and slammed it in my face that they figured out something was wrong: There was no way I was going to hang around out side with a monster in the area. I flipped out --screaming, beating,kicking the door  and crying for them to let me in. It was only a couple or three seconds and they knew something was terrible wrong. They let me in and I explained what I had just seen through tears. My father and his friend went outside to look around, probably thinking they would find a loose cow. I'll never forget the look on their faces when they saw the foot prints that dwarfed their own. My dad's friend was a tall man of around six foot two or three. When he stretched his legs to step from one foot print to another it was next to impossible. Their disbelief had turned to fear. They did however want to follow the tracks that went across a field that had been plowed recently. I freaked out again. They seemed to understand this time. They decided that going in a car would be better. We drove down a road a short distance, found were it crossed and went on up a hill.

We didn't have a car and we had walked about 7 or 8 miles to arrive.  We were both on the JV soccer team at our highschool and even though the season was over we were in very good shape.  For this reason we jogged maybe half the trip which got us there in time for saturday night live.  We stayed long enough for me to watch SNL with one girl and my friend to spend some private time with his beau.  It got to be late and we knew we had a long trip back to his place. I felt fine and wanted to leave after awkwardly watching TV with this girl.  Getting to this location was easy because it was mostly downhill, but getting back was going to take longer. We were still in good shape so we jogged most of the way back up the long hill on Town Hill Rd.(219) near Bakersville, but in New Hartford, CT. It was a crisp night without much moonlight. We had grown comfortable jogging side by side in the middle of the road.  Since it was so late nobody was out driving and we set a consistent pace for about 2 hours.  We finally made it to the top of the long hill where Route 219 flattens out.  We were casually jogging in the middle of the road past houses and an occasional farm when we heard a bad sound. It made us stop dead in our tracks and we were both frightened.  It came from the left of the road perhaps behind a farm and a fair distance away.  I distinctly remember turning my head as the sound swept from left to right and thinking to myself that is a big sound. I would like to comment on the sound.  I have spent alot of time in the woods of Connecticut and was familiar with sounds from area wildlife including birds, squirrels, coyotes, dogs etc.  I immediately asked my friend \\\"What the f!$# was that?\\\"  He responded that he did not know.  From the left, the sound was a cry that sounded like a cross between a baby and a woman screaming bloody murder that started very high, held for a number of seconds, and then came down in pitch.  When it got lower it changed into a broken cackle that made the echoes more pronounced.  It was very disturbing and unlike anything we had ever heard.  I asked my friend if he wanted to stay and check it out but he was very disturbed and did not want to hang around.  It was a bad sound that you don't want to hear in the middle of night.  We stood there for a few moments confused and scared, and decided to get going. We continued jogging for another hour discussing along the way what it could be.  Eventually we became more relaxed and the conversation moved onto other things like the events earlier in the evening.  Things were fine again and we were making good progress over a few more miles when we heard the sound again, this time on the right side of the road and closer. Again it was a blood curdling scream that held for a few seconds, slowly descended in pitch and cackled at the end, but on the other side of the road and closer.  We were now more scared and both had the feeling we were being followed or tracked.    I turned to my friend and said pointedly that we might not get another chance like this again and I grabbed his arm.  In panic he cocked his right arm back and said some expletives to the extent that if I did not let go he would lay me out flat right there.  He sprinted down the road without me and I had no choice but to follow him since I lost sight of him in the dark.  I caught up with him soon enough and we quietly jogged the remainder of the distance to his house though we were shaky. For years he was not open to talking about what we heard and he apologized for threatening me and leaving me standing there.  When it was discussed we never came to a decision about what it was. A few years ago I came across the BFRO website and started reading reports.  I listened to a few audio recordings from OHIO but nothing clicked until I read reports of screams.  The recordings on the site are like moans and long whoops, but some reports describe a more stressed vocalization that puts the listeners instantly into panic- this is what we heard.  Its a really really bad sound that is confusing because it sounds sort of familiar, but is so extreme its difficult to describe.  The reports I have read that describe the scream include hunters and military folks who pretty much bolt when they hear it. Since this happened I have worked professionally in molecular genetics and neurobiology at UCONN and Yale University.  I have also had careers in the financial industry as a quantitative analyst, and as a sound designer and audio engineer to the musical instrument industry. Whatever made the sound was able to project over a great distance, and kept up with us over enough miles to convince us we were being stalked.  I cannot say for sure what made the sound, but based on: other credible reports in the BFRO database, the similarity to other screams and our own responses, a sasquatch is my best candidate without invoking the supernatural which I personally would never do. Looking in the database for reports from Connecticut, the only one I found was surprisingly in the same County - Litchfield.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"New Hartford\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"We were on Town Hill Rd, Rt. 219\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"It was cold but not below freezing, and pretty dark without a moon.\", \"COUNTY\": \"Litchfield County\", \"DATE\": \"11/01/1987\", \"SEASON\": \"Fall\", \"MONTH\": \"November\", \"YEAR\": \"1987\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"This happened on Town Hill Rd, Rt 219 going toward New Hartford from Bakersville.\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"Between 3-5AM, moonless night\"},\n",

I have frequently visited this place throughout my youth, and adulthood to fish, camp, hike, bike, and hunt. The pond is spring fed, and is located in a flood conroll area. A town built dam at one end helps contoll the water level, but at the time of the incident the dam was poorly built. In late summer the water level in the pond would drop drastically, and create a higher concenration of fish. The best time to go fishing was at night when temps. were cooler. On this one particular night I decided to go moonlight topwater bassi'n alone. I parked my car at the entance gate around 9:00pm, and proceeded on foot down the service road. The moonlight was intense, and afforded me the luxury of saving my flashlight batteries for most of the treck. The trip from the road to the pond is approx. 3/4 of a mile, and takes you through several fields wich are cut in the summer.On the way i startled some deer that were around a salt lick, they ran off in the opposite direction of the pond. I walked through the final field, and over a stone wall, onto a path that leads directly to the spot on the pond where i wanted to fish.The area from the stone wall to the pond is wooded, and recquired use of the flashlight. The path, and woodline end in an area of land that juts out into the pond, forming a point. Due to the low water level, it was another 50 yds. walk to get to the waters edge. I fished off of a couple of rocks that jutted out even further. I had been fishing for approximately an hour, and havig some luck. The moon was full, and almost directly overhead. I was out in the wide open, and could see very well all around the shoreline. The woodline around the pond was spaced from the water at least 30yards plus in all directions. The moonlight did not penetrate into the woods, and so I could not see into them. I felt as though I were on center stage to anything that might be in the woods wathing me. All of a sudden out of nowhere a loud and deep sound eminated direclty from the woodline where I had entered the area. My knees went weak, and I nearly fell off the rocks. I turned to face the area in a ducking position trying to see what it was. The sound was again repeated after a short pause, and then nothin. I pointed my flashlight in the direction of the sound,but it was too far and too weak, not even an eyeshine. This was all that I heard. The sounds were as follows: WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSFSSS!!-twice in succession, then a short pause (10 sec.) followed by the same WWRRUUMMMPFSFSFSSS!!-Twice in succession. The sounds were deep, and came from something large, (200+lbs.) They echoed across the pond! They were definitely directed at me, something was letting me know it was there. I found it odd that pryor to and after, there were no sounds of walking in the woods. Watever this was made a stealthy approach, and exit. I never heard anything again.

It howled one more 2-tone howl before stopping at what we estimated to be 50 yds. away in the woodline. It seemed like it covered at least 50 yds. going through the woods while howling three times. Whatever it was was BIG and LOUD! There was a lot more bass to the howls than a dog/coyote/wolf has. Each time it howled it was 2-tone, in a series of three and it seemed unemotional or intelligent. About a minute later, another series of three 2-toned howls came from the hill to the south approx. 1/4 mile away. It seemed to be answering the one hiding in the treeline in front of us. Then the one in the treeline let out three more of the same howls. Let me stress again, this thing was LOUD! We were all pretty shaken.

We didn't know if we were being studied or they were getting in position for attack. We decided to leave. After some debate, we decided to pack the trucks while one of us took turns watching with flashlight and gun. A few minutes later we were packed and headed down the mountain to the main rd. We did not see or hear anything while packing or leaving. When we got to the road, we stopped to unload our guns and stow them legally in the trucks. There was one house close to the road and after a while the dogs started to bark. I joked to JG that \\\"they\\\" were coming after us. Just then, we heard another set of howls about a mile back the rd. we'd just come down. Whatever it was had followed us and we left immediately. We were not sure what it was that night but after talking about the incident quite a bit, we think we had a Bigfoot encounter. It was a remote, wooded, mountain location with a large lake over the hill. There were at least three intelligent beings communicating that sounded loud and large. We had been leaving our scent all around and had been cooking meat all day. No person would be crazy enough to risk getting shot playing a prank on us. The howls were very eerie. Like I said, they were all like the first 2-tones of a wolf howl but much deeper. There was no trailing off like a dog/coyote/wolf howl, just 2-tones. Each 2-tone howl was in a series of three howls that took approx. 5-6 seconds per series. The only thing missing from the encounter was the lack of the famous Bigfoot stench. There was no wind so maybe the thing in the treeline was far enough away for it not to reach us. We are not out to hoax anyone. We hope none of our colleagues find out so our day to day judgment is not questioned or ridiculed. This was the first time any of us had seen any of the other ones scared. We just felt that we had to share our experience for what its worth.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Bayfield, CO.\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"CO 160\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"It was mostly aspen and pine and there were a lot of deadfalls around.

But it reported a \\\"bigfoot sighting\\\" in an area that was about 40 miles from us.  Over the next 2 months or so there were several sightings that made the paper.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"We lived in a rural area of central Florida that was mostly pine forest.  There were a few hundred acres on derelict citrus groves nearby as well as a cypress swamp to the north and east of the pine forest.  The area we lived in was roughly 4 square miles between paved roads, but to the north, east, and west beyond the area I am describing, there were additional substantial areas of pine forest, palmetto scrub, and dense cypress swamp. Our house was situated on the crest of a hill, or at least what passes for a hill in that part of Florida. It was about 8:00 one night and I was home alone with my father.  My parents were separated and my father would occasionally come to stay with me when my mother and siblings were out.  During the late fall and winter months, it was our custom to shoot rabbits at night.  Our house was roughly square, with small flood lights on each corner of the house that would illuminate our small yard area and the edge of the tree line out back to the north and west.  We would typically wait until it was fully dark before we would go out.  We would load our shotgun in the house, get our flash lights ready, and on occasion my father would wear a headlamp, or as he called it \\u201ca one-eyed dog\\u201d.  We would leave the corner flood lights of the house off until we were ready, then we would turn the lights on and quickly step out the back door.  Most of the time there would be a rabbit or two, nibbling the grass at the border between our poorly kept lawn and edge of the forest.  Not a difficult shot with a shotgun at just under 30 yards. On this particular night it was my father\\u2019s turn to shoot.  I held a large flashlight, he held a Steven\\u2019s 12 gauge side by side double barrel and wore a less than powerful headlamp.  As we flipped the lights on and emerged from the back door he stepped to the right and panned east towards an old ear tree at the edge of the grass.  I turned west towards the northwest corner of our yard where there was a clothes line and an old bench my grandfather had made.  On the edge of our yard, just 6 or 8 feet from the tree line, was a large, crouched figure.  When I first saw the figure it was reasonably well lit from the flood lights on the house and from the upper edge of my flashlight beam.  By my first glimpse of the creature it was already moving, springing up from a crouch to a fully erect, bi-pedal stance while simultaneously rotating away from me (turning to the creature\\u2019s right).  As there was motion when I first saw it, I was not able to get any meaningful look at its face.  But as it turned I saw the creature with very good clarity from a distance of just under 30 yards.  It was not a giant creature \\u2013 it was almost the same height as my father (who was 5\\u201d10\\u201d), perhaps an inch or two shorter than he was.  Most of my view of the creature was from the back after it had turned and started moving away.  The creature was clearly much stockier than a man, with very large shoulders and not very much narrowing noticeable at the waste.  Its upper legs were thick and powerful looking.   It was covered in fur of medium length \\u2013 not shaggy or super long, but long enough to obscure the details of most muscle tone.   The fur was longer than that of a deer, yet not quite as long or as deep or dark as a bear.  The fur was not especially dark and was certainly not black.  The flashlight we had back then made everything look a little bit lighter, and a little bit more bluish purple than it really was, which I had previously observed many times when examining close up the rabbits that we had shot. The creature took 3 or 4 very distinct strides before its lower body became obscured from view by some undergrowth.  Its shoulders and head were visible for perhaps another two or three strides and then nothing could be seen because of pine branches and the fact that the creature moved beyond the area illuminated by the flood lights on the house.  I never shown my flashlight directly on it as I was stunned to the point of both immobility and speechlessness as soon as I saw it.  I will never forget the distinct look of the creature from behind.  It had some kind of deformity.  Its head was tilted quite far down on the left side with that side of its head at an awkward angle to its shoulder.  It was like the muscles or tendons in the left side of his neck had been injured and were now contracted a bit and shorter than the muscle on the right side.  It was not a temporary position or part of the creature sudden movement; that awkward, left leaning head position was maintained even as the creature ran away. I do not recall any vocalizations or any specific smell.  I do remember the sound of twigs snapping and leaves and pine needles crunching very loudly as the creature moved away.  The sound of it moving through the forest and undergrowth was quite distinct and had a cadence that no other local creature made.   The sound of the creature running stopped when the creature reached a small clearing about 70 yards into the woods (or I assume that is why the sound of its exit stopped based on its direction). My father who was with me saw nothing, although he heard the creature\\u2019s exit.  He was facing about 160 degrees opposed to where I was facing and the entire incident lasted perhaps only 3 or 4 seconds.  My father asked me what was going on and I was absolutely (and very literally) speechless.  I could not speak!  I simply pointed and stood there frozen.  He took me in the house and tried to get me calmed down, but it was more than 5 minutes before I could speak.  I remember feeling fear, but I think my physical reaction was actually a mild form of shock.  What I saw was so unbelievable, so unexpected, and so close.  I suspect my physical reaction would not have been any different than if I had seen a headless horseman. After about 10 minutes I had recounted what I saw two or three times to my father, who was clearly in disbelief but quite moved by my physical reaction.  At about this time we heard a loud, but distance barking, howling and baying from our closest neighbors hunting dogs which he kept in a large outdoor kennel at his home about 1 mile through the forest from our home.  We would occasionally hear the dogs bark at night \\u2013 but never like this.  I could see the look on my dad\\u2019s face change from disbelief to some level of fear as the dogs made the most agitated sounds we had ever heard \\u2013 and that we never, ever heard again.  We tried to find the phone number for our neighbor with the dogs, but we didn\\u2019t know where my mom kept it.  After about 20 minutes the dogs settle down a bit, although they continued to bark without the same level of agitation.  After another 10 or 15 minutes my father suggested that we go investigate the area where I saw the creature enter the woods\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026\\u2026I thought this was a really bad idea and wanted no part of it.  But my father insisted there was some explanation for what I had seen, and that I would feel better once I had things cleared up in my mind.   My mind was not unclear \\u2013 I was quite certain of what I had seen, although I could not explain it and had no name for it. Eventually we went outside, this time with both of us carrying shotguns. I refused to step away from the back door, but my father slowly ventured over to the area about 30 yards away and looked at the ground and the brush line.  He entered the brush line where I indicated and went perhaps 2 or 3 more steps and bent down again.  I kept my shotgun pointed in his general direction but not directly at him.  After just a few seconds my father came hurriedly back and said that we needed to get in the house.  He was clearly shaken and my construction worker, outdoorsman, purple-heart awarded father was afraid of nothing.   My father called the local Sheriff\\u2019s office, but when he started to explain things he did not know what to say.  He explained that I had seen something and was scared to the point of being speechless.  He told the sheriff about the neighbor\\u2019s dogs. But the more he spoke, and the less he said about the specifics of what happened, the more frustrated he became.  He finally told the Sheriff \\u201cnever mind\\u201d I\\u2019m sure it was nothing.  He did not give me any meaningful details of what he saw, but simply explains that \\u201csomething big clearly went through there in a big hurry.\\u201d  Both my father and I knew the woods well and we hunted all the time, spending hundreds of hours a year in these woods.  I had never seen anything like this creature before, and I never saw anything like it ever again.  I never saw any large animal tracks in that part of central Florida that I could not easily identify and I never saw any scat that I could not identify.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Palm Harbor\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"US Highway 19\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Pine forest with undergrowth.

I have not reported this for professional reasons, but now that I am retired, this is less of a concern.  At the time, I was teaching an Oceanography class at the local community college.  One evening of the week would be classroom lecture on campus and another evening would be lab or fieldwork at a science center operated by the school district.  I was also director of the center.  The center is located on an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico called Salt Spring Run, and surrounded by a typical upper west coast Florida Juncus-Spartina marsh with mangrove islands.  After class, approximately 8:30 or 9:00 PM, I drove out of the gates of the center, got out to lock the gates, and then drove down the dirt access road to the center.  As I came round a bend in the road, a creature stepped out of the vegetation onto the road.  I stopped and stared at the creature, which was illuminated only by my headlights.  It did not seem frightened and simply stared back at the car.  We were about 40 \\u2013 50 feet apart.  I had a chance to take a long hard look at the creature and tried to note everything I could.  It was not a human, nor was it an emaciated bear.  It had a simian face, flat nose (not a snout), and ears on the side of its head.  It was slim, not heavily muscled, and was covered by grayish-brown hair or fur.  The hair was not thick and bushy.  It also stood only about 5.5 to 6 feet tall at most.  I could see the entire body of the animal because it was out in the road.  It was turned sideways to me and only its head turned in my direction.  Because of the angle of view, I could not tell if it was male or female.  I was not frightened by the thing because I was in an old Dodge station wagon I had at the time, which was a tank.  Also, the creature did not seem agitated or aggressive, but simply wary.  Eventually, the creature calmly walked across the road and into the salt marsh at the edge of the road.  I got out of the car with a flashlight and tried to get another look at the animal.  I sniffed and tried to detect any odor, but there was no odor.  I never heard any vocalizations.  I eventually drove home and told my wife, but did not share this with anyone else.  Eventually, I told my sons, one of which encouraged me to make this report.  At the time, I was not only sober, but also well rested.  I was not sleep deprived, and had at least a full minute to look at the creature.  I simply do not know what I was looking at.  The closest thing to what it looked like would be one of those National Geographic artists renditions of what an early hominid looked like \\u2013 not large, slim, a walk with knees slightly bent.  The next morning I surveyed the area, but found no tracks.  The road was hard-packed limerock and oyster shell and even shoe impressions weren\\u2019t left.

We were on private land and not allowed to be there wich is why I suppose I never got to see what scared us so bad, I will explain. Me and tim were huntin all nite, mostly letting the dogs run and we just sit and listen for baying and then run to the dogs, catch the pig and release it. well this evening we had just left the treeling bordering a swampy area and were crouching down resting and smoking, Id guess it was 3am. Suddenly as we sat there, we heared what sounded like footsteps. We stood up and looked and listened, they immediately stopped.. we both whispered \\\"what was that\\\" to each other fearing a game warden or the owner of the land..then we heared a palm frond move and two distinct steps.We looked at eachother and ran three steps, stopped looked wide eyed, unsure of what we were hearing. then we heared a frond move and three steps and again it stopped. We turned, ran two and stoppped then we noticed it was immitating us, stopping when we did etc and comming closer. again we turned and took a step and it took a step and stopped. Me and tim looked at eachother and ran as fast as we could, we knew it was a game warden or a person, it had to be. we stopped after 200 yards or so and turned and looked there was nothing behind us but along the tree line we had left ( we were now 250yds across the swampy opening across from the tree line) about at 2 O clock position in the distance we coul hear something smashing its way through the undergrowth and breaking everything it touched heading away from us... we would always talk about it and I personally regret running, I had a strong light, I should havetried to get it closer, I think I could have, it was interested and following us. I know it was no animal, was easy to tell because you could hear it clear the path and then take distinct steps.. each step the exact count of our own. that is my story but I would like to add this. Timmy has been dog hunting every nite for 5 or more years  and after this incedent he described a  swtrange encounter where he was with three other people who all saw the same thing... He stated that one nite while hog hunting during a half moon him and the guys were stopped and resting when tim noticed an outline at the bottom of a tree.. all the guys looked and they became concerned and frightned because there was the distinct outline of a huge man sitting at the base of that tree, plainly outlined sitting on his butt, feet streight out in front of it..Tim said it had huge shoulders and was just eanourmous..he said \\\" We freaked out and ran like hell\\\" funny thing is it was again private land and at first they thought it was a warden, but after a few mins they had no idea what it was but became extremely afraid of that massive torso sitting at the base of that tree watching them. ( I am beginning to notice there is almost always a tree involved in these sightings) I believe timmy, there is no person I know who has covered more ground in pitch black woods than him and we spent a few together doing it.

The distance between the tree and animal vs myself was approximately 2000 ft. I was dropped off at this area by two other people I was hunting with.

I got up and walked down to the rivers edge and started shining the opposite bank. As I was shining I could hear something moving thru the brush towards me. As it got directly across from me I saw it thru the brush and could see a shoulder and head moving left straight across from me. I could see it moving for about 5 to 6 feet before it came to a tree where it stepped out from behind the tree and looked directly at me. I shined the light in its face and saw two red eyes and a head and right shoulder. When the light hit it in the face it turned its head back to the direction it came from and took off back that way. It seemed mad cuz it started stomping and growling and breaking limbs again. It continued to raise hell for another hour to hour and a half before it went quiet. Of course we did not sleep that night and at the first light we got in the boat and started rowing towards home and made it about 5 miles where we were picked up by the Nassau County police boat and towed another 10 1/2 miles back to Scotts Landing.  It was a truly amazing experience for me, my buddy however didn't agree with me. He said he was frozen with fear and will never return there.

Also, report 15170 was in the exact same area. I emailed my mother and father about the event a year ago, and I'll edit to protect the names/paraphrase what they had to say about it. In an email, I asked my dad if he remembered the night, remembered throwing a rock in the woods at what we heard, and what exactly happened, here's his response: \\\"I remember that night very, horribly, well...  We had been camping at the very Southern tip of Everglades National Park.  If the same camping area still exists, I think it's now called the \\\"Flamingo Campground.\\\"  Nice name.  If you don't quite recall, here's the link - http://www.nps.gov/archive/ever/visit/camping.htm Anyway, we set up our campsite, and I believe it was on the first night that we chose to do some night-fishing along one of the zillion canals in ENP.  We had the little orange '73 Honda Civic parked on the side of a canal.  As you recall, we heard the leaves rustling s-l-o-w-l-y as something or someone moved back and forth.  Although I don't remember it, I probably did throw a \\\"rock\\\", aka \\\"rock sponge\\\", aka, a piece of uselessly light coral.  Nothing happened, so I shone our huge, massive, bright flashlight with a big 6V batttery right at the source of the sounds.  Of course, the vegetation was too thick for decent light penetration, but NOTHING was revealed.  And, most chilling of all, what/whoever it was, pacing back and forth, continued to pace back and forth in a most non-wild-animal way.  I/we shouted, to no avail, and I got a series of impressive chills down my spine. I said, \\\"Let's get in the car!\\\" and we took off down the little side road while Mom said, \\\"Do you think it was the Skunk Ape?\\\".  I was carrying our surf-casting rod with my hand along the roof of the Civic, and was really, really glad to be out of there.\\\" I then emailed him back and asked him if he smelled anything: \\\"No, I don't remember any smell.  In the cold light of dawn, I thought that it was probably just an armadillo or some other exceptionally stupid animal that didn't know how to be afraid of light at night.  It didn't even stop moving, let alone run away, when I turned on the flashlight and swept it around the area the sounds were coming from.  I remember being so afraid that I didn't think there was time to break down the surf-casting rod, so that's why I carried it with my hand, gripping the roof of the car with the rod against it.  It was the most scared I've been in my adult life.\\\" Here is my mom's response to my original email: \\\"I remember  that  I was sooo scared I didn't even open the car door I shoved you thru the window and you piled in on top of a bunch camping gear,  cooler ect... Dad had to drive backwards  too. I have to say it was one of the most scariest things that has happened to me.\\\" Personally, I remember mostly being terrified as a child, because my parents were.  My dad in particular, is not one to scare easily.  On top of that, he is a lifelong scientist who views all 'strange nature' occurrences with a very stern skeptical eye.  So as an adult, to think back on his fear, and have him admit how scared he was, means that something instinctual kicked and told him to haul butt out of there.  If he thought it was a person, he would have confronted them immediately. I've seen him do exactly that on many occasions.

It lurked in the darkness in a lightly forested area off U.S. 441 half a mile south of Belleview, he said. \\\"I've got some information about Bigfoot,\\\" the tremulous voice on the telephone said. \\\"I think I just saw it.\\\" Monday morning a security guard for an Apopka nursery told police a 10-foot-tall hairy animal with a chestful of reddish- gray fur and small ears attacked him, ripping off the terrified guard's shirt.

The Bigfoot sighter - a Belleview welder who didn't want his name known - said the beast was brown and black. \\\"I'm six feet tall and it was bigger than me.

I was not going to go into the hunting camp, rather decided to hunt along the railroad track bordering the camp along dirt road. We were probably 3 miles deep in a wooded area off main road.  I positioned myself on edge of railroad, with the tracks and very, very thick forrest and swamp bottoms directly in front of me. I had been watching for deer for maybe 30 minutes, when directly in front of me in the thicket maybe 100 feet, sound began to develop.  It was louder than anything I'd ever heard in the wild.  It sounded like a very deep growl/exhale that lasted what seemed like 20 seconds. It happened a second time about a minute later.  This time it sounded closer, but I couldn't see anything in the thicket.  I remember thinking I probably wasn't armed with enough firepower, although I was holding a 30-30 highpower rifle in my hand.  I felt as though whatever was making the noise was big and strong based on the powerful noise I was hearing.  I started walking toward where my friend was parked.  He met me walking the dirt road and picked me up.  I told him what I'd heard; he laughed and made jokes.  We left the area and didn't return until next year to do some scouting in the exact same area. We were without rifles at this time because it was before season started.  When we were walking in the swamp bottom, my friend brought up the incident and laughed some more.  It was no more than 5 minutes later when in front and to the left of us, WE heard the  noise again.  He looked at me like, \\\"What the heck was that?\\\" I said, \\\"That's it, that's it!\\\"  We turned and got out of there very quickly.  When we got to the truck, he now believed me with regard to what I'd heard the year before when we were in that exact area.  We left and started driving the dirt road just looking to see if we could see any deer, or any other wildlife that could be walking that afternoon.  As we drove back by the woodline that we had just exited 10  minutes earlier, we noticed on the woodline bordered by a field, we saw what we thought was a deer grazing at about 100-125 yards.  We stopped the truck to watch. My friend decided he would try to get closer by walking the woodline toward the deer.  As I watched him walk slowly toward the animal, I noticed the animal was moving toward him on all fours.  I told him that it was moving toward him.  He stopped and I think either clapped his hands or yelled something.  At that second, this thing stood straight up on two legs. It was white on the underside and had no distinctive shoulders. It looked as though it had a pointed head and we thought it stood about 7-8 feet.  My friend turned and ran back to the truck. We were both scared enough to leave but before leaving we tried to position the headlights toward the subject for better identification.  But it had entered back into the woodline.

I just graduated from high school (1981), class valedictorian, and  had begun my freshman year at the University of Florida in Gainesville. It was around 7:30 am with a fair amount of light. Fall was just rolling in and the air was beginning to cool. It was a clear morning at the end of August and I was on my way to my first class, The drive from my parent\\u2019s home to school took me through heavily wooded, sparsely populated areas of north central Florida. I was on highway 27 between Bronson and Chiefland, coming around a big bend in the road.  The trees had been clear cut from the edge of the road for about 100 yards on either side. As I followed the curve, a movement on my left caught my eye. Someone was walking out of the tree line and towards the road. I slowed and pulled over, finally stopping my car as I tried to frame what I was seeing in terms I could understand, The \\u201cperson\\u201d walking from the woods was huge, well over 7 feet tall. I kept wondering what a tall, naked, hairy \\u201cman\\u201d was doing out in the woods at that time (or any time) of the day. I never had the thought \\u201cskunk ape\\u201d or \\u201cBigfoot\\u201d\\u2026I truly wanted to find a rational explanation for the creature that crossed the road (in just a couple of steps) and continued, unhurried, towards the line of trees on the other side. As I sat in my car staring at the creature, it turned to look at me, moving the upper torso to do so. I felt like we regarded each other for quite some time and, as stunned as I was, I was not prepared for what happened next. The creature reached down and swung a \\u201cjuvenile\\u201d up onto her hip and disappeared into the trees, clearing a small barbed wire fence in one step. I do not know how long I sat there, trying to sort it out. I know I was late for class, and I never told anyone, until recently. I have never been able to say that what I saw was a Sasquatch, Bigfoot or Skunk Ape (the most common term in my area). I just know I witnessed something remarkable.

It looked like it could have been about 6 \\u00bd - 7' tall. We had one gentleman that hunted there with us that was just under 7' and I would say it was about the same height as him from a distance.  It had such a thick build with gray hair or fur covering all of its body.  A somewhat fluid stride for its massive size. Not knowing what I actually saw and wondering if maybe it was hunters from another camp, I turned around and started to walk to the person that was closest to me in the other direction, hoping that they had a truck that I could ride back to camp with them in, being the only female and not knowing exactly who or what it was that I saw, I thought it best to go find someone else from the camp at that moment to be around. The day was a nice cool, bright fall day, approximately 11:00 am.  That night at camp over dinner I had told the others  what I had seen and they all said that I saw my first swamp monkey. The next day I didn't venture too far out of camp to hunt by myself, because what ever it was had crossed from another camp into our hunting area.  After a while I did get the nerve up to get a little pellet gun and walk down the road to look for squirrels.  I made it down about 50 yards down the road and started to notice that there were no sounds from the woods. No birds, no squirrels, nothing.  Then I heard something just inside the wood line breathing and grunting  growling   thinking it may be a wolf or bear I turned around and started to walk back to camp.  What ever was next to me did the same.  I started to walk faster then jog, the animal in the woods did the same.  Laughing to myself I stopped to catch my breath, so did the noise in the woods.. no more footsteps but more harsh breathing.  I couldn't see any shapes or movement but decided to run the rest of the way back to camp and did not look back.  That was the last time that I had any such encounter of that kind.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Gulf Hammock\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Hwy 326 & US 19\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Heavily wooded hunting acres with boggy marsh areas and truck trails and one deep pond with gators on west side.

We were about three miles back and we started smelling something that I can only explain as being a dead carcuss mixed with a skunk. We have always been interested in Bigfoot, so I knew that it stinks but didnt think it was in central florida. Although there has been sightings in the ocala national forest. We keeped walking and came up on an old logging or ranger trail, it was covered with overgrown grass and had branches all over it. The road had palmettos lining it with a creek or runoff ditch on one side. We started walking down the trail towards our house. We were still about 2 3/4 mile from 337 when we came up on a bend in the trail. We walked around slowly to try and see deer or maybe some hogs on the trail, knowing that there are a couple herds in the area. There was nothing so we keeped walking. I told my friend to stop walking because I thought I saw something standing about 150yds down. I pointed at what I saw and we couldnt figure it out. He told me it was probably a tree, seeing that the had spray painted the trees to get them cut down. We keep walking and then it moved quite quickly toward the side of the trail, by then I was really nervous. We watched it from about 100yds away. It stayed on the left side of the trail neeling in some palmettos just staring at us. After about 10 minutes we were able to slowly get down in the creek out of the road but makeing sure it was still visible. After about 15 minutes of us staring at it, not believing that we actually are seeing a bigfoot it got up and walked back across the trail being followed by a smaller less intimidating one.

I noticed a light from a nearby house was still visible, so I moved about 30-50' further down the road; Ron and Rick stayed put.  As I put up the tripod, I noticed a foul stench coming from the woods nearby, on the opposite side of the road from the houses.  I asked Ron & Rick if they smelled anything, and they laughed, thinking I was playing a 'skunk ape' joke on them.  I said I was serious, so they moved towards me.  One said he smelled it, and then Ron said 'I don't hear any crickets chriping.'  I then became aware of the unusual silence.  Ron & Rich immediately turned and ran to the house; I grabbed my tripod & camera and followed.  We go to the house, and before going in agreed to not tell anyone, so they would not make fun of us.  The next morning, B4 breakfast, the 3 of us returned to the area.  We found the exact spot from where the trees blocked the house where the light I had moved to block came from, and there was no smell.  I pointed to an area where I thought the odour had originated, but we could see nothing from the road due to thick underbrush and small trees.  We walked up the road, found a way into the underbrush, and came back to the site.  Rick had stayed on the road to orient us back to the correct area, and when we found him throught the trees, the area directly where I had pointed to as the origin of the smell had a large [@4' x 5x] area of matted -down underbrush.

That was my bedroom at the time and my brother and I kept our toys in there. We had one smaller window and beneath that is where we kept our toy chest, and in front of it was a chair. I went into the room, sat on my legs in the chair and opened the toy chest. I grabbed all kinds of legos, and after I had grabbed the last lego that I could have possibly held, I sat up straight and there in the window were two piercing red eyes. I just stared at them. My arms let go of the legos and they dropped back into the chest. I stared at those eyes for minute and than ran down the hallway. I had no idea what it could have been. I yelled over and over again that there was a wolf in my window. But my parents just assured me that it was probably the dog next door. Okay, we lived in a mobile home meaning it was on blocks, and no dog, even on their hind legs could peek into the window. That window was set high off the ground. And it wasn't like it was eyes looking from below. These eyes were in the middle of the window, so whatever it was had to have been tall enough to be able to look in. They were like human eyes but not quite. For years I tried to figure out what it might be. I thought maybe an owl..but they have yellow eyes, and there were no trees close enough for a bird or animal to perch on and be that close to the window. I mean, it was right up against the window.

      "{\"REPORT_NUMBER\": \"11387\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class B\", \"OTHER_WITNESSES\": \"Only me. My husband and daughter were asleep.\", \"ALSO_NOTICED\": \"Just the rattle of the cans at our campsite.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"Only those on the BFRO website.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"In the summer of 1994, my husband, daughter and I went camping in Ocala National Forest. I love to be out in nature, but frankly, I'm a little freaked out at night. But, nonetheless, I tough it out. Despite my nighttime reservations, I told my husband I wanted a primitive campsite, away from any other campers. We found a gorgeous spot in a primitive camping area that was surrounded by high brush nearly all the way around three sides; the back side faced the woods. We chose this particular site in case other campers moved in. This spot was secluded and private from the adjacent campsites. I have always been an extremely light sleeper, especially when it's night and there are flexible walls between me and the outdoors. I would love to sleep under the stars, but I'm much too chicken. We had brought sodas with us on the trip and were putting the empty cans in a plastic bag that we left laying next to the picnic table. The first night we were there, I was just dozing off when it sounded like something hit the bag of cans pretty hard. I was, immediately, awake shaking my husband, who can sleep through an explosion, and asking him to get up and check it out. He refused and went back to sleep. To the best of my knowledge, this is when I must have become aware of the screams far off in the distance and to the north. I lay there, awake, for the longest time listening to these screams, trying to figure out what they were. I don't know why, but it seemed to me that they must have been about a mile away. They sounded like whomever or whatever they were, was very upset. I lay there for what seemed like hours listening to these screams. They were almost continuous. I told my husband the next day that it sounded like the (extinct) Timucuan Indians were having a war party and were screaming most of the night. I figured their spirits were reenacting a battle or something. It might not have been going on for as long as it seemed, though; when something is disturbing your sleep in the middle of the night, it can seem like forever. Indians fighting was the closest sound I could equate it with, until this evening when I listened to the newest, March 5, recording from the couple camping in Washington. Now, I have heard the Puyallup and Snohomish recordings many times, but never put it together with what I heard that night. The reason is, these earlier recordings are of a single scream, but just as the March recording clip ends, there is a scream which sounds like it is immediately answered by another scream. These 2 screams on top of one another, instantly, clicked in my head. Hearing these screams together were, EXACTLY, like the screams I heard that night. I was never frightened nor did I feel threatened by them. They were too far off, and besides, I never knew a Bigfoot type creature existed in central Florida, at that time. I thought they were exclusive to the Everglades. Only recently, have I found out that they have existed all over Florida. Even though they were far away, they were very distinct to me; as I recall the night was very silent and still. The one thing that helps to calm me at night are the familiar night sounds, but these were absent on this night. By the time I drifted off to sleep the screams were dying down, as well, but had not, completely, stopped. The first thing I did the next morning was listen for the sounds, but they were gone. I thought I might have been imagining them, but hearing this latest recording confirms to me that, maybe, I wasn\\u2019t. However, your website infers that this type of scream/howl seems to be limited to the Pacific Northwest. But I can tell you, I heard these same screams right here in the largest nature preserve in Florida. When you hear something like that, you never forget it, and I will never forget that night or those screams. When I awoke the next morning, I expected to see our bag of cans scattered on the ground, that is how loud the bag of cans rattled, but nothing was disturbed. The cans were, still, all wrapped up in the bag. Nothing else had been disturbed, either. The other thing that has always baffled me about that night was as soon as I spoke to my husband, the cans stopped rattling, and I didn\\u2019t hear another sound, except for the distant screams. I was raised out in the sticks, as it is called, in the foothills of North Carolina, and I know that your average nocturnal critter, raccoons, opossums, etc don\\u2019t just flee at the sound of a quiet human voice. The sound those cans made was much louder than a small animal rooting around, but still, it could have been any average nocturnal animal. I didn\\u2019t look outside the tent, and since I was unaware of the possibility of a Bigfoot creature in the area, it didn't occur to me to check for prints. The next night, after we had gone to bed, a group of young people pulled in to a site about 20 or 30 yards from us and partied until about 2:30 a.m. After they left, I listened but heard no screams, that night. The night sounds were back, so I slept much easier the second night. Other than the partiers the second night, there were no other campers in this campground the entire time we were there. If anyone else had moved in during the night, I would have heard them. But this campground was nearly vacant, except for us, of course. We were, quite possibly, the only campers for, at least, a few miles from this spot. I\\u2019m not saying, for certain, that what I heard, that night, were Bigfoot calls, but now, I have a good explanation for what has mystified me for years. My husband, who is in the military, recently, transferred to the north central part of the state. Soon, we will be moving to the Alachua/Bradford County area. We are hoping to purchase some acreage out in the country. I can\\u2019t wait!

It was New Years Day 2000. There is a state park called Rainbow Springs State Park. I went to the park that morning simply to bird. This is a fairly large state park but only a small fraction of it is open to the public. That morning I wanted to go outside the public areas of that park, just find a trail and keep walking. The ground was white sand and there were no human foot prints anywhere. I remember this distinctly because I was IDing foot prints of animals and insects. I had a pair of binoculars with me and I was looking for birds as I went along. I figured I was about 2 miles into the park when I came to a clearing, and a stand of White pines on the edge of a field of Saw palmettos. The pine closest to the edge of the clearing had a wood duck box mounted on it. I noticed that right away. It made me laugh because the river or nearest water source was over a mile away. I figured a wood duck that used that nest box would have to be desperate. I decided to look at the box through my binoculars hoping I would see a screech owl using it considering I have seen this quite often.  It was then when I noticed something gripping the tree trunk well below the wood duck box. I thought I was seeing things but it was a reddish brown hairy arm. I raised my binocs to get a better look. What I saw still bothers me today. That arm was attached to something that can only be described as a bigfoot. I got a very good look at it. It was hugging the tree its face pressed to the back of the tree outta sight from the front. It would peek out to look at me then pull back. It had grayish black skin around its face. It was pretty much hairless. It had a human like nose, with a slight nose bridge and a nose more typical of people of African decent. It was not like an apes nose at all. They have flat noses with upturned nostrils. You could not see its nostrils. It had no white to its eyes.The eyes where all brown with black pupils. I could see them dart back and forth, very similar to how a terrified or trapped animals eyes look. Its lips were thin and it appeared that they were long for its mouth looked rather big. There was very little hair around the face. It pretty thick on the sides and top of the face/head. I couldnt see any ears. It appeared to have a very short neck with the back of the neck kinda fading into its shoulders. It had a small cone shape to its head It looked very muscular but not blulky. I moved several times to my right and left to get a better look and it moved just like a squirrel does around a tree trying to avoid you. I can't say how long this actually went on but it  had to be several long minutes cause I was busy running thoughts through my head as to what I was seeing. The closest thing I could come up with was this had to be an orangutang. The color may have been right but after that, forget it. I decided to move forward,  just to get a better look I took two steps toward it (it was about 100 yrds away) and it ducked down and ran like hell. I didn't see it as it ran away but it left a sea of moving palmettos in its wake.

It was still pretty far away. Three Sundays ago (10/15/00) the dog kept going off, starting around midnight till 2:30am, my husband,C., went out several times with the rifle but never heard or saw anything. At 2:50am the dog went ballistic and C. told me it was my turn. When I opened the front door you could he it over the dog barking. It was all the way back into my property behind the horse lounge ring at the back of the property line. It continued to sound off as my husband was loading the other rifle for me and then it sounded like it killed something, this was awful. When we got outside, we stood behind the truck about 50 yards from where the noises were coming from. Then it stopped but heard no movement in the woods, the dog continued this entire time sounding off. After about 5 minutes of silence, my husband shot off a round into the ground and could hear it break branches as it moved behind that old parts truck in the woods. Then he let off another round and it went farther in the woods and that was it. I called Fish & Game and went through the same old BS I did a couple of years ago. I went to K-Mart and bought a GE auto voice recorder and we started setting it out at night. We got it on tape that same week, we never heard it from inside the house but were able to hear the dog barking. I have let several people listen to it and no one can ID it. Again, this is not like anything that I heard prior or like on those tapes. Last night (10/28/00) we had a party after my art show, two of the people who previously heard the tape were there. We had a fire going for a bar-b-que and we were all pretty loud. At around 10:00pm you could hear it over all the noise in the same general area. They ALL HEARD IT. Except two women that went to get Lotto's at the store. Three male friends and one of their girlfriends were over by the lounge ring where they had parked their car. When we ran over to them, the one guy who had  previously heard the tape said \\\"what the #@!% was that?\\\"  We heard it moving in the woods and we ran in the house for the recorder and the rifles. Total Chaos!! There were no kids present at this time only adults. We listen to it WALK in the woods and you could hear it breaking branches as it moved. One guy said \\\"Its big whatever it is\\\" And another turned to me and said \\\"it sounds as though it's walking on two feet\\\". We never mentioned that from the first experience, but we heard it and it did sound as thought it was two footed. C. went back into the house to get the flashlight and he and R. went into the woods, whatever it was stayed at least 100-200 feet away from them. The whole time R. (ex-law enforcement officer & paramedic) could hear it breaking the branches as it moved through the woods as he guided my husband in the general direction it was moving in, (My husband can't hear certain tones from a far distance) never saw or heard it again.  We also had a Realtor friend, D., and some good ole boys. A good mix of people and no one could ID the sounds, only that whatever it is has an attitude and is big.

At this point I could tell there were no ears such that a bear would have and knew it definitely was not a Florida black. The upper body was massive and as it went down to the hind quarters got increasing smaller. I would estimate that this animal would be 7ft aprox. weight would be around 400 lbs (my best guess).I could not tell what the hind feet looked like due to the amount of hair but I did note that they were longer than that of a bear. As he neared the edge of opposite side of the road he then returned to walk on all fours and as he entered the edge of the wooded area he stood upright again placing right arm on a pine tree, looked over at me and at this i was at a stand still in my vehicle, I could see a full face. Distance from the animal was 50-60ft away.I could tell that he had more of a round shaped eyes, from this distance they appeared to be dark in color with a lighter color of hair around eyes (short and greyish brown, older in  appearance) same hair color would be around the side of face and what would be the area where the ears would be. The nose appeared to be shorter than that of a bear but different than an ape, didn't have a larger lower lip or chin. the area where the mouth and nose is was short hair and skin appearance.I could also see that the long hair on the arms did not go all the way to the hand area.

When I got-up off the bench, it probably immediately saw me and stopped. It was now vulnerable to me since I was in an elevated position and it did not have the protection of the trees. I figure it probably just knelt down behind the brush (think it's called \\\"saw palmetto\\\") and waited. I didn't see it as I was coming down the tower. I believe that when I slipped and came down with a loud thud in the brush, I startled it and it popped it's head up to see what was happening. It was purely by coincidence that I just happened to be looking in its direction when its head came up. It must have realized immediately that there was no point in hiding, because we were looking right at each other. I think we both froze in that instance. After a few seconds, when it began to flee, it moved across the clearing until it crossed the road. It could have retreated much quicker into the woods behind it but I don't think that is where it wanted to go. It needed to get across that road and perhaps it panicked. I know I did! Although it is not unusual to me that a frightened or startled animal would turn and run, the fact that this animal did in-fact RUN is not consistent with other sightings I've read about. The witnesses always seem to state that the subject calmly or hurriedly WALKS away. This one ran!\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"I spoke of the other sightings in south florida, but none this far north. I've never heard any other witness ever describe a \\\"skunk-ape\\\" as having silvery-gray hair. I don't know what I saw, but I know it was an animal, it had silvery-gray hair, it was too big to be anything else but a bear and bears don't run on two feet and don't live this far south.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"I am a 39 yr. old professional in Miami, Fl. I had an experience 24 yrs. ago that I will never forget. When it first happened, I shared the details with family and a few close friends but no one believed me. It became a topic of such ridicule that I just stopped talking about it (what was the point). I've always had a casual interest in the bigfoot dilema. When I moved (in 1974) to south florida, neighborhood kids would tell me stories of a bigfoot-like creature (they called it a \\\"skunk-ape\\\") roaming the fringes of the everglades with the occasional sighting. They said it was large (about 9'), smelly and a very swift runner. This all seemed too bizarre and I really didn't believe them. Then when I was 15 yrs. old I had my experience. I'm not about to say that what I saw was a skunk-ape, but I can say that (since my experience) I absolutely believe that animals (even large ones) can co-exist around us without our knowledge of their presence. Here's my story .... I was with my family on a summer camping trip at Johnathan Dickinson State Park (just north of Jupiter, Fl). There was an observation tower (about 30 ft high) along the same road that leads to the campground. About 5:30 or 6:00 pm I jogged from the campground to the tower alone (it was probably 2 to 3 miles). When I got there, the fence around the tower was locked. Since this was an un-manned tower setback from a road that had very little traffic (in-fact the entire time I was gone from camp, there were no cars), I decided I would hop the fence. I'm not one for blatantly breaking rules, so I was very careful not to make too much noise climbing the fence. When I got to the top of the tower, there was a built-in wood bench that wrapped along the perimeter of the deck (about 12'X 12'). I spent about 5-10 minutes looking in all directions (but there wasn't much to see). The skys were clear and there was about 45 minutes to an hour of sunlight left. There was a clearing of low-lying brush (about 3-4 ft high) that extended out from the tower for about 30-50 yds. in all directions. At that point it became pretty densely wooded. It was peaceful up there and I was tired so I rested for about 20-30 minutes by laying down on the bench. When I got up, I noticed the sunlight was beginning to fade so I figured I'd better get moving. I remember being upset with myself for staying so long because I would not make it back to camp until nightfall and I didn't want my parents to worry. When I got to the base of the tower, I climbed the 8' high fence at a point that was perpendicular to the road. Once on the other side, I could walk the 100' or so along the fenceline to the road. Unfortunately, I slipped at the top of the fence so I instinctively pushed off the fence and dropped to the ground on the other side. When I came down, I landed in a bush which made a lot of noise (I had been deliberately very quiet up til that moment. The position of my body was slouched over and facing away from the fence towards the woods beyond the low brush. It seemed as soon as I hit the ground, making all that noise, something popped its head up from under the brush (about 25 yds. away) and I saw it immediately because I just happened to be looking in that direction. I saw just its head at first and we just stared at each other for a few seconds. At first, I was not sure whether I was looking at an animal's head or a person's head. I remember it was rounded at the bottom and more elongated towards the top. It seemed a little bigger than mine and was covered with short silvery-gray hair. Its face seemed human with a flat nose, its eyes were small and dark. It made no sound. After a few seconds of silent starring, it turned towards the road and began moving quickly. It seemed to be running on all fours at first; but after about 10 yds. it stood up on just two legs and continued to scamper until it crossed the road and then disappeared into the woods. I would guess that it was about 6-7' tall. It's frame was very large from the hips up and it was covered with shaggy silvery-gray hair. After it was out of sight, I stood there for a moment trying to rationalize what I had seen. I saw it clear enough to know what it wasn't. It wasn't a man - it was definitely an animal. It wasn't a bear, deer or panther. Not even close. Surprise had turned to confusion and was now becoming fear. I didn't want to hang around (defenseless) against an animal larger, stronger and faster than myself. I ran back to camp, checking behind me as I ran. By the way it had reacted, I assumed it was probably as scared of me as I was of it. When I reached camp, I tried to tell my family, but they just laughed it off and said it was probably a dog or a homeless man. Of course, I knew this was not the case, so I became upset. Not wanting to continue the conversation, my father became stern and so I dropped the subject. The next day we went home and I've never been back. Until recently, I've pretty much kept this story to myself over the past 24 yrs. When I found your site (and some others)on the internet and read of other encounters it motivated me to share my experience. I sent info about my experience to a web-site dedicated to finding \\\"skunk-apes\\\", but I really found much of their material to be uncredible. I wanted to share my experience on this site because I feel your opinions and observations are genuine, thoughtful and reserved. P.S. I remember watching the local news one night (around 1977) about a supposed skunk-ape sighting by not less than 14 people during an air-boat ride thru the everglades. They interviewed the driver and a couple of riders who stated seeing a large hair-covered animal walking upright near the edge of an island in the swamp. I thought having so many witnesses would have made this a more credible and compelling sighting. Although I have read of many sightings in Florida which matched the stories my neighbors told me when I was younger, I have never seen or read anything (on the internet) about the airboat sighting. Have you or any of your readers ever heard of this sighting.

This where the old town of Pinecrest used to be located in the thirties.  Al Capone ran a speakeasy and gambling joint in the area at that time.  I was walking on the path that makes its way around the pond at E.I.  There were five geodesic dome cabins around the pond.  It was just after 10 PM.  My cabin was number three. It was pitch dark out, with no moon, and there was twisted jungle and you can imagine that kind of plant growth if you've been to the Glades. I became aware of something way off to my right of the path I was walking to my cabin I heard scattered footfall noises.  Twigs breaking.  I didn't think anything of it.  There are deer all over the place there, so it was no big deal to me at first. However, when I stopped to listen.  The noises stopped. I would start to walk and they would resume.  Each time I would begin to walk, and the noises resumed BUT MUCH CLOSER EACH TIME. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. DEER DON'T DO THAT!  They prance away, they don't come closer! Now what still amazes me, and what was most peculiar about was happening to me then was:  How can anything move so quickly through that undergrowth,...  I mean, you know, it didn't make sense.  And no person could pull a trick like that, you'd poke your eye out on a sharp branch. After the third time I had stopped,...and resumed walking, the noise was very close.

The field wasn't lit up,...but I became relieved as I became aware it was dropping back,...and at one point it ran back into the woods loudly and the scattered noises it made in the thicket were just a few and then nothing, no sound.I felt it was watching me from just out of sight.

It took an hour for me just to go back outside, so maybe it left while he was dismissing the incident over his theory it was a jaguarundi, or someone's pet cougar that got away, and went wild. Big cats growl, and this thing that breathed like it did was no cat.

My only real regret was that I didn't have a shared experience with a friend who could vouch for what happened. I did not feel this creature is benevolent, or passive like you might read about in other stories.

Drum and Okeechobee, Florida on Jan. 18, 2004. It was almost dusk, approx. 5:30 PM. There was only one other car on the road and it was several miles away in the west bound lane coming at me ( two lane road). I took this opprotunity to remove my sun glasses. A spring type clip on which I need both hands to remove. I turned my head and dropped them in my purse on the seat next to me. As I looked up toward my rear view mirror a flash of movement caught my attention. It happened so fast all I saw was the last few steps of a small hominid running across the road in front of me. It wasn't close but I'm not sure how far away. It stopped on the edge of the road for a split second and made a leap over the roadside ditch and a barbed wire fence. I tired to reason I had seen a limpkin or a sandhill crane but knew it wasn't. I braked as soon as I saw the first movement and slowed to 20 mph by the time I thought I was where it had leaped into the bushes. I couldn't see any bushes moving or water movement. I was so intent on looking at the side of the road I didn't think to look into the pasture on the other side of the barbed wire. If I had been sure in my mind I had seen a wading bird I wouldn't have slowed as I see them all the time. I knew in my heart it was something different from what I'd ever seen before. I have reported this to the Mysterious Encounters web site and have thought more on it and will now revise my estimates of it's size. I judge it to be 3 1/2 to 4 feet tall and between 75 and a 100 pounds. It had a very round head on an upright body no neck to speak of. The hair was long and silky not matted or tangled. It was a brownish red, more light brown than red. I'm sure it had it's head turned away from me and I was seeing the back of it's head as I didn't see any facial features. I remembered seeing it's foot later. It was like a person of color whose skin is darker than the sides of their feet. The hair hung lightly over the sides of the edges of it's foot. I saw one arm and it reached almost to the knee.  When it leaped it didn't swing it's arms out or bend it's knees to jump it just leaped flat footed, pushing off. The distance it leaped was approx. 20 to 25 feet. Seeing it bothered me and then I saw the Redwood Giant episode of Mysterious Encounters, Jan. 24, on OLN. A man on the show said a three foot tall hominid ran in front of his car in NC. It hit me like a shot, I knew what I had seen then. That's when I filled out the report form on their web site. I did a Google search tonight and found your site. The more I've thought about it and talked with my family ( after they stopped laughing) we have come up with other times we could have been in the presence of these hominds over the years. Once two years ago my son and I were on the Kissimmee River, the western boundry between Okeechobee County and Highlands County, Florida. We heard a call...scream.. yell, from a distance. After discussing it my son said it must have been a big bellied redneck out hunting or a skunk ape, we laughed it off but kept a watch around us the rest of the day. It was very disturbing. A year a go a friend and I were on the board walk of the Grassy Waters Preserve on North Lake Blvd in northern Palm Beach County, Fl. It was early morning and we were walking to the end to go into the little nature museum and looked out across the water and sawgrass toward a cypress head. Standing in plain sight was a BIG dark figure. It would bend over and do something in the water at the base of a cypress tree, then stand up and act like it was eating something. This went on for quite a while, bend over- stand up. The woman who was in charge of the museum came out with a pair of binoculars but they were so badly fogged we couldn't make out details. Just a big homind figure. There are many more times and incidents I could relate but they go back to the mid 1970's. So I will stick with the present.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Ft.

My brother, dad and I always went to the back pasture where we would play in the pond which connected to the swamp. we had a pretty good dry season one year an we went back to the pond to see how bad the water had gone down and noticed very large tracks of some sort, as we were approaching the pond first thought was one of the cows had walked through but as we got closer they were human foot tracks but abnormally very large tracks. My dad had a tape measure in the truck we drove to the pond we measured the tracks an they were approximately 29 to 30 inches in length. I'm not sure how big Bigfoot tracks usually are but I've never seen anyone with feet that big. My dad said that it was people tracks but I beg to differ. I'm not sure on how wide they were but my guess was that they were around 10 inches wide. I know when you get reports like this people exaggerate some and even a lot but I'm a 1000% sure on what i saw I've never seen anymore tracks after that, Since my brothers and I are in the woods a lot hunting and I've never seen anything like it. I've heard strange noises in the woods and in the swamp that I couldn't explain or even could possibly mimic but who knows could be anything. Also this wasn't the only encounter that I've had, It was a couple years ago me and a buddy of mine always hog hunt in the woods on the back side of our neighborhood with his parents. We decided to go for a walk to a little slew we had found while hunting. We gotten about 100 to 160 yards into the tree line the moon was full so the woods came alive. As we got on to the game trail, I noticed something in the palmettos among the oak trees. I told him to stop and get down and be still that I think i see a big hog by the oak tree about 30 yards off the game trail 50 yards ahead of us. He spotted the figure by the tree and we began to watch it. The figure never moved so we stood up to keep moving. When we did it quickly stood up and quickly moved behind the tree we just froze and watched to see if whatever it was would come out of hiding. As we were watching the tree we heard something heavy footed walking around the pepper trees off to the side of us, my friend freaked out and took off running out of the tree line toward the houses. I had no choice to follow after him because I did not wanna stay to find out what it was by myself. As I turned to run I seen a tall figure through the pepper trees, I didn't stop to see what it was but it was huge and wasn't on all fours as I reached the fence. I heard a low gurgle sounding exhale come from the trees, my first thought was a bear but I have never seen or witnessed a bear in Florida. Of course they are here but I've never heard of anyone seeing a bear in the town i lived in, but it was bigger than any bear I've seen.

This happened in Orlando, Florida around the early 2000\\u2019s,  we lived in a suburban area but around it has a heavy forest area and this was before any of the major shopping centers and housing were built. My cousin had come up for the weekend from Miami to hang out, we were probably in our second year of high school. I remember it was around 2am to 4am and we were driving home and before our entrance to our neighborhood there is a small lake with a patch of forest in the middle of it, and across from it there is the neighborhood playground and a daycare which was pretty dark at that time so my cousin decides to pull in by the playground to smoke a cigarette.

Tall grass, swampy area with virtually no trees between the highway and the furthermost part of the clearing.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"I moved to a small, rurual area outside of Orlando, FL (from Missouri)just a few months ago and I'm still learning my way around the area.  Subsequently, my wife and I often drive around on the weekends to get better familiar with our new home town. Today, (Saturday Sept 2, 2006) we struck off to go to a shopping mall called Waterford Lakes and it was en route to the mall that I saw something peculiar. My wife was driving today, so I was relaxing looking out the passenger side window at the various swampy patches that are so common in central Florida and I must confess that I'm always looking for wildlife. My wife teases me because she knows that I'm primarily looking for aligators and thinks that it is such a \\\"tourist thing\\\" to be doing. However, on a couple of occassions I've actually spotted aligators sunning themselves, as well as numerous deer and turkey, so I feel justifed enough to keep looking. Well, we were traveling south on the Florida Turnpike and just saw a sign for the Ocoee exit when off to my right I saw a man walking in a very swampy & rugged section of meadow about a hundred yards to the right of the turnpike. As he was going in the same direction as we were heading, I was able to watch him for about 5 to 10 seconds and really didn't think too much about him other than he was pretty gutsy to walk in that area all by himself, considering that he seemed to walk with an odd gait. Another strange thing was that he seemed to be dressed in all brown from the head down to his knees (the tall grass covered his lower legs, so I can't say if this guy was wearing shoes or socks). Please note, this took place at about noon, on a very clear Florida day and I believe that the temp was about 93 degrees, so seeing a guy walking around such an area without a hat, or short sleeved shirt is unusual. Well, by this time we passed the fellow and I kept looking off to the right to see where he might ultimately be headed, but for the next few miles all I saw was more swamp and grass. As I stated, my wife was driving and didn't see the man, but I was talking with her about it as it happened and she asked me a few questions (she thought he was probably homeless). When I started describing the man to her, I started to question whether or not the \\\"fellow\\\" I saw was necessarily human.  For example, either his hair was very, very bushy, or this guy didn't have much of a neck.  Actually, his head looked a little pointed. He must have been fairly big, because I could clearly see him even at 100 yards distance, yet try as I might, I couldn't identify a single article of clothing on him. Finally, I couldn't even confirm his skin color, because I literally only saw dark brown over his entire body, including his hands. I must confess, I'd be thrilled to think I might have seen a bigfoot, but I just don't know because my first thought was that this is just some poor idiot who was going to pass out from the heat in the wilderness.  But on reflection, I think could be wrong. One thing I can say for sure is that he didn't seem frightening or monsterous in anyway.  I would imagine a bigfoot encounter to be much more exciting than this.  However, I was at a very safe distance and in a moving auto, so I might feel differently if I met him on foot.

In the pre-dawn hours of the morning my husband was not even half way on his commute from Space Coast to Disney World to report for his early morning shift, like he does 5 days a week.  He takes the 192 which involves a loooong stretch of road with seemingly no sign of life anywhere for about an hour until you reach the St. Cloud area.  My husband slammed on the brakes to try to avoid what was in the road without hitting it dead on, all the while trying to avoid flipping his Volkswagon Passat. Unfortunately, he could not avoid contact, and he struck the massive 9 Ft. Gator. He pulled the car over after attempting to resume driving, realizing the car was now undriveble. He made phone calls to the insurance company, his job, and me. I head out on the same stretch of 192 to retrieve him.  His vehicle is being loaded onto a flatbed and he is waiting with the tow truck driver who is nice enough not to leave him standing at the side of the road in the middle of nowhere at (now) 6 o'clock in the morning. I am driving, wide awake, looking the whole time for this piece of road kill.  I want a photo of it. No I am not morbid, but he said it was HUGE, and I take pictures of all wild animals I come across. Bunnies, snakes, gators, whatever.  I drive a long time, the sun is breaking over the line at the moment I finally come to the Gator.   It is daylight enough that I can drive without headlights and I can see outside very well. I see it up ahead in the distance, I see the Turkey Vultures. The BIG BLACK birds that come to eat the road kill.  My eyes are darting down to the road, up ahead the highway looking for the tow truck, back to the monstrous mess in the road.  I am slowing down so I can photograph the Gator, and I am reaching for my camera.  As my eyes follow a 3-pack of the large birds up off the road and cross over the the right, I see a man walk into the woods up ahead. He is up ahead a distance I would call a block. A block away.  He is wearing ALL BLACK.  His elbows are bent as he is walking,  and he disappears into the woods. So I am pulling over now, snapping photos of the disgusting mound that is so large in the road that if it's not cleaned up, and if someone hits that, there is going to be another accident. And I am fully awake and present in the moment.  I am running a checklist in my head.  Gator. Birds. Man. Man ?!?!  What Man? Why would a \\\"man\\\" be out here at (now) 7am exactly, walking around in the woods. There are cows here.  Lots of land you pass on this road has cattle being  raised for beef. Oh, and a DEER sign. A sign, just a moment back I passed , warning of Deer Crossing. (Thanks for the heads up on the 9 Ft. Gators).  So he's tending to his cows?  A ranch hand? Where's his truck? Where's his Cowboy hat? . So I recall this again.  A man - in ALL black- no change of color for face or hands- Wearing a black hoodie? On a beautiful, warm, dry, summer morning- in August- in Central Florida? He's not  looking  when  a car pulls up? He  walks into the woods that are headed nowhere?  I don't think so.  Makes no sense.  I think I saw a Bigfoot. So it took me about 2 minutes to put this all together and I didn't want to leave!  I wanted to go in after him.  I couldn't. My husband was waiting and was all revved up from his climactic morning.  He would be angry if I delayed, goofing off. The tow truck driver had waited long enough. I snapped like 2 pictures of the mess in the road and quickly moved on. Putting this all together in the months since the event, it makes more and more sense that what I saw was a Florida Skunk Ape.  Of course he would be pulled out of the woods at the knowing of the HUGE road kill.  It was dark for more than an hour while that Gator sat there in the dark. There was time for a Bigfoot to hoof it on out there and check out the scene, hey, he even had enough time to pack a bag lunch. Nearly escaping unnoticed before the sun came up over the horizon. It has been almost a year, and I am planning to go back to said location and search for prints and evidence one day. I have driven by the exact location approximately 6 times since then. Each time going over and over it in my head.  I am so angry with myself that I had camera in hand, and came up empty.  But even driving in the passenger side with the camera hanging out of the window I can miss a pic of a deer!  Nothing could have prepared me to photograph a \\\"hey--maybe that's a \\\"somethin'  \\\" at a moment's notice.

I grew up in the area and had covered on foot, horse, swamp buggy, canoe, etc. But they ranger still wouldn't let us go. So we walked the boardwalk and I looked out to the cypress heads and squatting down at the base of a cypress tree was a dark figure. It would dig a little in the mud at the base of the tree and stand up and put a hand to it's mouth. I asked a Ranger for binoculars and she came out to look. The humidity was so high the binoculars fogged over and were useless. We watched the figure squat down and repeat, dig around, stand up and it did it over and over. Another Ranger came and my friend and I watched this motion for about five to seven minutes more then left. I have no idea how long the rangers watched it or if they saw it leave. If it turned out to be a bear that would thrill me too. No bears had been seen in Palm Beach County since 1979. But I'm sure it wasn't a bear. It stood too straight and bent at the waist and squatted at the knees like a human. A Bear doesn't bend the waist. I had forgotten about it until after I had a sighting in Okeechobee Co. I filed a report on the Okeechobee sighting and spoke with and went out to the area with an investigator. I've decided to report the first sighting because of the way Fish and Wildlife handled a sighting here in Columbia County, Fl where I now live. Big joke, lots of laughs. I take offense to that attitude. I've spent a life time in the swamps and woodlands of Florida, put in 12 years as a wildlife rehabilitator in Palm Beach County.

They said they had seen \\\"something big\\\".  I asked them what color and my son said brown.  I assumed it was a deer or wild pig as there are many around, just told them to be careful, and brushed it off. A month or so later, there was a show about Bigfoot on TV and my son came to me and asked if there were Bigfoot in Florida.  I told him no and that they stay up North.  I didn't want him to be scared of the woods.  I didn't tell him about the Florida \\\"skunk\\\" ape sightings. About 6 months later, my neighbor called me to ask if I or my family had ever seen anything unusual in the woods.  I was sitting in the car with my son waiting for school to open.  My neighbor told me about the sightings he and others had last fall.  My son heard the conversation and started interrupting, telling me he saw it. My neighbor heard him over the phone and started giving me questions to ask.  Height?  Very tall, taller than parents.  Color?  Reddish brown.  Was there a bad smell?  Yes.  I asked him what did the ears look like, were they pointy, rounded or what?  He said he didn't see any ears, just head and hair. My son and friend were playing in the woods when he saw something moving in undergrowth.  He saw the back of something that looked like it was on all fours.  As the back was large and tall, he decided to move closer to the house.  He felt very nervous.  As they were leaving, it seemed as if the something was moving toward them.  He also remembers sticks being thrown.  He urged his friend to move on.  Then at one point, he turned to look and he saw this large thing looking at him from behind a tree about 10 ft back.  It was standing up and very big, tall.  The tree was at least 2 ft in diameter yet it had wrapped one arm all the way around it.  There were many vines and branches on the trunk so he didn't get a good look at the body, but he insisted it was standing on two feet, not hanging on the trunk.  He said the eyes spooked him.  He started running and his friend followed.  That is when I saw them coming out of the woods, all out of breath. I asked him why he didn't tell me he saw Bigfoot when he came out of the woods, instead of saying something big.  He said that he didn't know there was such a thing as Bigfoot.  Then when he saw the show on TV, he asked me if they were in Florida and I had said no.

Dead silent.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"None\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"Well where do I start. Oddly enough, here, at my last resort. Let me please start off with the whole I'm not crazy speech. I live here in Central Florida and work as a Deputy Sheriff for the past 16 years. Add to that my time in the military and being some what of a hunter and one could say I have spent a good bit of time in the woods and around the world. However about 1.5 years ago myself and a friend (with a similar background) heard something while hog hunting at night that to this day rattled my very being. The location was near Lake Hatchineha in the Poinciana area of Polk County. The time was close to 2am. We were still hunting in an open area with a heavy woodline between us and the lake. What we both heard is difficult to describe since I had only ever heard a similar sound in a movie. Yep a movie, and excluding that in my four decades of life and travel I have never heard anything remotely close. It was not a whoop or a howl or a cry but what I can only describe as a chuffing noise. Now if you want to listen to the only thing that I have been able to find that comes close, watch Jurassic Park and when the raptors call to each other, that's it. But here is where that similarity ends. The sound was much deeper and had a slight rumble at the end. From our position it sounded at least 1/4 -1/2 mile away. The noise was made four times like (chuff-chuff-chuff-chuff)  then complete silence and by that I mean not even the birds were chirping.  Both my buddy and I had that whole hair on the back of the neck thing going on big time. What set our nerves on overdrive was after about  an hour later we heard it again. This time it was to our north and only about 50 yards away. Needless to say it was much louder as in I honestly felt it in my chest. What ever it was it was big and moving our way in the tree line. We could hear it moving slowly to the west and it did not sound like a deer, bear, or any of the many other animals I have heard or tracked ever. I will say this. I do not scare easily. I have been alone in deep woods in the green swamp and never had a second thought. But that night I have not and will not ever forget. We hunted the rest of the night back to back literally. Now I assume your wondering why am I writing this here. Well in truth I have searched every site on strange noises with no luck. I have spoken to countless others about it with no luck and got in touch with my buddies at FWC with no luck. Am I a believer? Well my thought is simple - why cant they exist? Did we hear one that night? I have no clue. I am making contact with you because as I stated earlier this seems like my last resort. Maybe you or someone has heard the same thing and can identify the animal.

Our neighborhood borders a series of orange, grapefruit and tangerine groves that are all adjacent to landfill and mining property.  Around 7:30 pm my daughter asked, as she does typically, \\\"dad, lets go look at the pigs\\\". About three to four times a week we ride these groves on our four wheeler and survey for wild animals. We've seen bobcat, coyote and pigs. In the past two and a half months we have been following a family of pigs which when we first sighted them had around 15 piglets about a month old. So we have been spotting them to see the growth of the piglets who are about 40 lbs now. After making our normal rounds around a few sections of groves we had not spotted the family. After riding slot down one of the main grove roads she spotted a big boar and we kept moving. The four wheeler was giving us some problems so I ran up through the gears to maybe clean the carb a little which put us about a quarter of a mile down this main road further back into the groves. We then turned around and returned to the spot where she had seen the big boar, well a few rows of trees short, where we slowed our pace to view this pig. Sure enough he was there. Three rows of trees past this location was the intersection of another heavily traveled grove road where we slowed down and turned the four wheeler off to listen for any more pigs. Just after shutting the four wheeler off a smaller boar crossed the adjacent main road....and then another, another and another. Three boars crossed. Immediately after seeing the boars, in the opposite direction we both heard four simultaneous noises. Now I consider myself an avid outdoorsman, hunting small and large game and also fishing for the last 25 years. I've seen and heard just about every animal in the local ecosystem and still hunt alligators yearly. After hearing these noises my immediate thought was...\\\"what are people doing out here\\\", when my daughter asked what was that dad? If you've ever heard a panther cry in the wild, than that was the closest animal sound I could explain to my daughter that we might have heard. Immediately after telling her that I heard her take a quick deep breath and quickly looked in the direction she was when I saw what I cannot describe as any animal I have seen in 25 years. I saw something dark brown, upright and moving very quickly across the row between the trees. My daughter asks \\\" dad, what was that\\\" when I replied \\\"I don't know\\\". I kill 10 to 13ft alligators for sport and am not easily frightened. This animal made the hair on my arms stand on end and chills run down my body. After studdering in my nervousness, we finally got the four wheeler started and sped off to our house. On the ride home, after i had in my own mind dismissed all other possible animals, told my daughter that I believe what we saw was a Sasquatch. The next day after work my dad, daughter and I went back to the location to look for hair, footprints or any other signs of the animal with no results. The sand was too soft to even make out the pig tracks. I did however stand with my daughter and have my dad walk to where we saw this animal and do a size comparison. We estimated it to be between 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and 2 feet wide. Pigs and other 4 legged animals are low and long so I know for sure that's not what this was. So after hearing these sounds and seeing what we saw, the only animal that I can compare to it was a Sasquatch.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Highland City\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"CR 540-A\", \"COUNTY\": \"Polk County\", \"DATE\": \"16\", \"MONTH\": \"May\", \"YEAR\": \"2013\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"8 pm.

Myers to visit my grandparents (as we did every December). We stopped in Ocala National Forest \\u2014 I don't remember the campground because we didn't get there until after nightfall, and I remember we went to Alexander Springs the next day, which was close by. Anyway, we drove through the campground and picked one of the last spots, several empty camp spaces away from the closest camper. The night was mild (certainly compared to North Georgia), and we all had sleeping bags, so we just pitched them on the sandy ground under the stars. My mom and my brother and sister were together near the road, but I wanted some space, so I was about ten to fifteen feet away closer to the end of the space. I wasn't afraid of the outdoors; I had already been whitewater canoeing, spelunking, camping, hiking, etc. I loved to hike, and catching snakes was a particular interest. Anyway, I loved being in the woods, and I knew that even bears are scared of humans, and didn't think anything would bother us in a camp site, even if we were on the fringe, for there were a dozen or so other campers around, particularly a small group about four or five campsites away who were having a bit of a party. Anyway, it was late, probably around 10 PM, and so we got in our sleeping bags and went to sleep. I dozed off for...I don't know, maybe an hour...and suddenly woke up. It was pitch black and very quiet, except for the footsteps. At first, I thought it was some big man walking through the saw palmetto; it was definitely bipedal, which is what threw me later. I figured someone was either drunk, looking for a place to pee, or lost. I remember cocking an eye to the trees and could see no light reflected from a flashlight. I remember thinking it odd how someone could navigate the woods in total darkness without a flashlight (which is why I figured it was someone drunk out to relieve himself). After about fifteen or twenty seconds (perhaps a dozen footsteps, crunch\\u2026crunch\\u2026crunch).  I realized it was coming into our campsite; I say IT because I could now hear it breathing, and whatever it was, I realized it was not human. It sounded like something huge, like a Santa Gertrudis bull. I lay very still, listening. Suddenly I heard it very close to my head, no more than a feet away, and it sniffed deeply several times as if it was checking me out. I was suddenly seized with terror, and I have never been afraid like that before. It was an odd reaction; the back of my mind was telling me that it was probably just a bear (the only thing I could think of that would be that big) and that it was simply looking for a pic-a-nic basket. I was wide awake, and I never have had those \\\"night terror\\\" dreams; I was fully conscious. I simply did not want to move. I must have flinched, because whatever it was suddenly went silent. Although I could not hear it, I was certain that it was still there, watching me. After what seemed an extremely long time (it was only about ten or fifteen minutes), the regular noises of the woods stated to come back, and I could hear small animals rustling about the dried palmetto leaves around the camp. I quickly got up and went over to wake up my mom, and I told her that there was a bear in the camp. She grabbed a flashlight, but all we could see was a short way into the woods around the camp. She laughed at me for being scared of nothing. Well, I went to the car, locked the doors, and lay down in the back seat. I had a hard time going back to sleep. At first light we packed up and headed off to Alexander Springs, and that entire trip my mother teased by about how I was so frightened by an armadillo (yeah, an 800 pound armadillo.) I didn't think to check for prints (I did run and quickly snatch my sleeping bag where I had left it), and I neither saw anything nor smelled anything. But I convinced myself that it was a bear, for whatever it was had enormous lung capacity, but it always bothered me that it was obviously walking on two feet, and it left without making a sound.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Ocala\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"SR 19\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Ocala National Forest; they used to film Tarzan movies there.\", \"COUNTY\": \"Lake County\", \"SEASON\": \"Winter\", \"MONTH\": \"December\", \"YEAR\": \"1974\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"Can't remember; I wasn't driving, and it was at night when we got to the campground.\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"Middle of the night, probably around midnight or just after.\"},\n",

I call it a bigfoot because I am certain of what it WASN'T. Definitely not a bear and the liklihood of it being a human in a costume is extremely remote.

Various accounts groaning up in the area of \\\"swamp boogers\\\", some of which were from my grandfather.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"On Saturday, 11/21/09 I went squirrel hunting in the Escambia River Management Area in Escambia County Florida. I began to walk into the woods at approximately 6:00am. The area I chose to hunt is a section of woods bordering the river. As I was walking, I heard a low, guttural vocalization that sounded almost like a native american dialect, only in a much lower range than most people would speak in. It reminded me of the Samurai chatter that I have heard on your website and others. I heard the sounds for about 10 to 15 seconds, and then once again a few minutes later. On Wednesday, 11/25/09, my oldest daughter and I returned to the area to hunt squirrel. We hiked back into the woods for about a mile, and found a log to sit on amidst several promising looking trees with squirrel nests. On the way into the area, we walked a game trail and smelled that \\\"wet deer\\\" smell that you often encounter around white tails. Almost immediately upon arriving, my daughter asked if I heard what she did. I asked her what it sounded like, and she said it sounded like someone walking through the woods. I told her I did hear it, did she think it was a deer, or wild hog, or some other animal. She said \\\"no daddy, it sounds like a man walking\\\". I had noticed myself that the steps sounded bipedal. Upon leaving the area, I decided to take the opportunity to show her various signs of wildlife in the area. The game trail goes throught the middle of a small meadow. The meadow contained tracks from deer, wild hog, turkey, armidillo, racoon, etc.. There are many fallen logs in the area from hurricane Ivan a few years ago, and they have become prime locations for grubs to inhabit. This is probably why so many different types of animals are making use of the meadow. One track in particular caught our attention. It was the bare footprint of what appeared to be a large man, toe prints included. My size 13 boot is 16 inches in length, and this print was approximately an inch longer than my bootprint. The print was made in a soft mound around an ant bed. I placed my boot print in the mound as closely as I could. The surrounding ground was too hard for tracks to show. My daughter immediately assumed that it was a bigfoot track. There are stories of \\\"swamp boogers\\\" in this area, so it really did not surprise us. I took a photo with my cell phone, which as soon as I can figure out how to download to the computer, I will  be glad to provide. I put a 3\\\" shotgun shell in the print crossways to show the size. It was about 5\\\" wide in the heel, and closer to 7\\\" to 8\\\" broad just before the toes.r\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Century, Florida\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"U.S. Highway 29\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"River swamp.

One was when my daughter and I returned home from church and I`d misplaced my key. We were standing outside on the porch waiting for my husband and son to come home when we heard an awful scream coming out of the reserve. We lived right next to the Reserve. I owned peacocks so I know what they sound like. Some people say they sound like a person screaming. I always liked them and their call never bothered me. This was something I`d never heard and it scared us both. We ran to the car and locked the doors and waited. My husband said it was probably a panther. I never heard one so I don`t know. Also a friends brother-in-law came down and stayed in a mobile home that their family owned.  It stood empty most of the time. He left very suddenly and I asked my friend what happened. She said he saw something come across the field in front of the mobile and look him in the eyes. He said something big and black. She said that he was seeing things. She said he drank heavy and he was seeing things that weren`t there. She said that all the black bear were hunted out and that there wasn`t any around the area anymore. Her and her family were big into hunting then. My daughter bought that mobile and land after she got married. She asked me one day what I thought he saw. I told her probably a big black dog or maybe a panther. She said go out and look in the window. I did and I had to stand on my toes to see over the sill.

We were in no hurry so we took the long way around. We liked to see if any new homes were going in. Montura Estates at that time was very scarcely populated.  It is a very large area and then what people that lived there were widely scattered. Very heavy pine woods, palmettos and cypress swamps. It had been raining earlier and still was drizzling off and on. I saw a person come up out of the woods further up the road and start walking in same direction we were traveling. I remember thinking who would be out  walking on a day like that. We were traveling very slow. This person then crossed road in front of us and still continued traveling same way. As we got to where we had to turn we slowed up even more. That's when I realized that this person was still heading south on Hacienda. He had crossed over Hunting Club Ave that we were turning on. That is when I really looked at this person for there was nothing out that way at all then.  I then saw that there was hair blowing on its legs, long hair.  I then realized that it had hair all over its body. It was black or very dark. Its hair on its head was long and seemed angled to its shoulders. Its arms were held close to its sides. Very big, over 6 ft. tall. 300lbs or more. The trees were very tall and even the palmettos were very thick and tall so I`m not sure how tall.

He said was that what I thought it was?  I said I think so. We backed up but It was gone. We looked down Hacienda all the way to the end and back. We traveled down Appaloosa Ave. We looked for a while but never saw it again. When we returned home we told our children but then we said our eyes must have been playing tricks on us as it couldn`t have been what we thought we saw it must have been a tree along the road. My husband told his aunt and uncle and they looked at us like we were crazy, so again my husband said it was a tree. He never talked about it again. I never told anyone either.

I was looking down at my camera adjusting the ISO settings and I saw something large move out of the corner of my eye (to my left) approximately 200 feet away. As soon as I saw the movement I looked directly at it and it was already halfway across the trail at this point. My eyes were directly on the animal as it walked, upright, across the rest of the trail and into the palmettos. It was very large (at least 6 feet tall or more) completely black in color with a VERY wide chest from front to back.  It was walking completely upright with a very fast, purposeful pace. The animal was leaning forward slightly but did not seem awkward with its steps - like a bear would be while walking upright. I slowly walked over to the spot where I saw it cross and I could still hear it moving through the woods in the distance.  I immediately noticed that all the birds around me had stopped chirping and the insects had stopped making noise as well.  I looked for tracks or hair left on the plants in the area but found nothing.  I was able to get a picture of the palmetto on the trail where it crossed and I put my tripod near it for a height comparison.

I thought it was strange such a sudden silence and I smelled what semed to be the sent of a skunk. I thought that was strange because i had been living in Florida 20 years and never smelled a skunk. I thought there were no skunks in Florida. I sat up thinking i would go outside the tent and see what was going on, when i looked to my right i saw a shadow cast on the tent from the lighting in the campground, what looked to be like a man and my first thought was,\\\"surely no other campers would take our food in the night.\\\" It made a noise that i questioned was a bear but didn't sound like any bear noise I had ever heard and I'm originally from upper Michigan near the Great Lakes very remote area with alot of bears and had seen and heard many in my life. Then i got to thinking this figure was standing up and not on all fours and was so tall I thought it couldn't have been a man stealing our food. There were not many campers on the grounds that night either. At first I was approaching the door of the tent to go out and investigate when i heard the strange noise again. It sounded like a grunt noise. I did not feel this was a bear but couldn't imagine what it was, I was somewhat frozen in fear for a minute. Then I started talking to my girlfriend  trying to wake her up and she was scared. We only had one small flashlight and no weapons as we sat there stating we wish we had a gun,  so i did not go outside of the tent, but could not go to sleep that night. The next morning at early daylight we came out of the tent to find a mess. Our coolers had been ransacked, most food gone. I attributed this to the raccoons but realized they were not there long enough to make such a mess i didn't think. So we just laughed about it most of the day and joked about Bigfoot but never did we actually think that was what may have been outside of our tent and eating our food, We had to go in to town for more groceries that day. Late that night things felt strange and it had been lightly raining all day, to a heavier rain by nightime. we sat in the tent playing cards talking about this thing i saw outside the tent. We decided to get out quick, packed our stuff up and even left the tent. At work a couple days later i asked a friend at work who had been there the week before camping if she had ever seen any bear there and she said yes. But when i told her what i saw she said it sounded too weird. It took a few days before i unpacked the car and then realized we had left behind the tent. I called the Ranger at Alexander Springs and told them we had left our tent. They stated they wondered what had happened to us. We told them to keep the tent or dispose of it. They said they could store it for us till we came back again. We told them we didn't think we would be back anytime soon to go ahead and do what ever they wanted to with it.  We did not tell them of our experience and I never told anyone because i thought they would think I was crazy. When I came across this site i was hesitant to report it but my girlfriend has encouraged me too. I know that what i saw was not a bear and way to tall to be a man or even a tall man.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Alexander Springs, Ocala Nat. forest,Aster\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"State road 40\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Many lakes, deep forest Ocala National Forest & springs.

For the first two hours after dusk, I was by myself and heard what seemed to be three large animals, breaking branches and knocking on trees all around my camp; they moved in what sounded like a triangular pattern, came between me and my vehicle, which was only 20 yards away, and broke a branch that had to be thicker than my wrist. Later in the evening, we heard a very strange, gurgling sound that sounded like nothing I have ever heard before. All this was followed by a 25 second tree-knocking session that would have amazed anyone who heard it. These sounds had to be made by an animal with opposable thumbs; if they were made by humans, they would have had to have been able to navigate one nasty swamp in pitch black dark with the speed and agility of a cat. The guys that camped at that site the next night had audio recorders and got some. As for me we had one low quality tape recorder that didn't pick up more than the wind.

It was a follow-up trip from a BFRO expedition and just lasted the weekend. There were about 12 expeditioners and it was in Central Florida. The first night didn't see much action. The next day which was saturday was when a friend and I decided to check out a location where sightings had previously occurred. We all visited this location before and saw or heard nothing. On this day we drove up to the sight because my friend had not been there. As soon as we got out of our vehicle we heard a loud whack! We both looked at each other and nodded our heads. About 20 seconds later we started to hear rythmic knocks. My friend was quite shocked at what he was hearing. That was when we decided to get out the baseball bat. I told Matt that whatever we heard responded back the same way we did. As this went on I decided to go out and investigate. That was what we were there for so I walked around the area. I saw no tracks or anything around the sandy areas so I decided to go beyond this area into the woods. Matt and I kept radio contact the whole time. Another member of our trip was also monitoring our conversation from a couple of miles away. Once I got into the woods there was alot of fallen leaves on the ground and every time I took a step I made alot of noise. The freaky part is that when I would stop I could distinctly hear something moving about 60 yards in front of me. It sounded bipedal and it's steps were louder than mine. Meanwhile back at the truck, Matt was still hearing knocks. I kept making excuses fot what it could be. There was a slight breeze blowing through so I figured maybe the trees close together were maybe bumping. That excuse went out the window when the knocks turned rythmic. Also the walker I heard made me assume that maybe possibly I was walking onto someones property. My other friend who was listening to our talk stated that the whole area was nothing but woods and eventually I would run into a lake. He knew this because his cabin was only a mile or so away. The walking continued fot about 8 to 10 minutes. After it stopped I decided to book. I thought it unwise for me to wander further into the woods alone.

I will leave that conclusion to those with more knowledge of Sasquatch behavior to decide. At the time my knowledge of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or the skunk-ape was limited only to what I had seen on t.v. or read in the papers rarely. In fact, I was under the belief that the Patterson tape had been debunked and bigfoot was probably a myth. It was a clear March day and I being off from work decided to take a day hike in Rock Springs State Park. The park is not heavily used I think mainly because its reputation for a healthy black bear population keeps city dwelling day hikers well clear of it. I have hiked many time in bear country and the idea of a bear encounter wasn't a worry. I decided on a loop trail approximately 2 miles in length basically as a warm up then planned on hiking different parts of the area. The woods very basically slash pine and palmetto with clear scrub meadow and shallow swamp areas a little deeper in. A well defined trail led through the palmetto. About 1/2 a mile in I noticed the woods had become very quiet and I began to feel as if I was not alone but being watched. In the middle of the trail I came upon a very large of very fresh scat. It was directly centered in the middle of the trail and the stools were incredibly large and long approximately 3 having lengths of between 9 and 11 inches. This was not bear scat as I have seen piles of that before and never saw continuous lengths of stool such as this. Again feeling that I was not alone I developed the strangest feeling that this was there for me to find and that it was meant as a warning not to go further. The fear I felt became almost irrational but I had no doubt I should turn around and leave this area. I have spent many hours in the woods but had never felt this type of flight or fight feeling. I now know that primates have used scat to mark territory and warn others away. Could this have been a warning left by a primate to me?

Wekiva river Basin.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"Only after reporting.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"Hello, I contacted someone from your organization about a year ago regarding my encounter in central Florida back in the middle 80s. I was called away to work and was unable to continue with the call. With that said, I would like to finish sharing my experience. I was working as a fence contractor in central FL during the 80s. We had obtained a job to build 10 feed plots for deer in a remote area off of hwy. 44 near the Blackwater Creek area of the Wekiva River Basin. The acreage is vast and was utilized for big game hunting. Since there was a deadline, we had all of the fence material trucked in and we set up camp at the end of the access road. This allowed us to be onsite until all work was complete. On the second day of our stay, we (myself and a helper) were surveying and clearing a fence line in the early morning hours, it was still misty with little light coming through the trees. There was four of us total working, so we split up into two teams to knock out the 10 plots. While my helper and I were clearing brush we were commenting and joking about an odd odor (skunky/sulfer like) we had been smelling a few minutes before reaching the site of the first plot. As we were pulling a string line, abruptly, a dark, bipedal form stepped into our fence line about 60 yards ahead of us. At first we thought it was one of the installers working with us, but as it moved closer to the clearing you could clearly see it was not a human. It appeared to be mostly covered with orange/brown hair, un-human long arms and an odd shaped head (wide, pointy and large) with a very short neck. Once it stepped out, it seen us as well, and when we shouted out the names of the other workers it quickly vanished into the treeline. We viewed the creature for what seemed to be 60 seconds or so before it bolted off. My helper and I were stunned at what we had seen. We spent a few minutes trying to rationalize it but there was no doubt we witnessed something extraordinary. I was carrying a side arm so we walked up to the clearing but could not see anything through the trees, however we did hear something moving rapidly away from us for a few seconds. That was the first of two encounters. The second encounter happened on the fourth night of our stay. All four of us were at camp which was set up on the bank of Blackwater Creek, about 15 feet from the waters edge. That area of the creek is approximatly 12 feet in width from bank to bank. We had began to cook dinner and were still carrying on conversations about our sighting of a hairy creature two days prior, with the other installers ribbing us saying we must had been drinking on the job and such. There was a cooler that we had tied to a rope and placed in the creek to keep the contents cool. As we were eating a loud splash from across the creek startled everyone. One of the other installers ran down to the creek and found that our cooler was gone, as well as the rope and stick it was tied to. We all walked down to the creek bank but there was no sounds other than the normal water movement. The missing cooler was chalked up to raccoons or an alligator. As we settled back into eating, one of the guys walked away to relieve himself, as he returned to the truck everyone looked at him, he was silent and all the color was gone from his face, he just looked at me and said \\\"I'm sorry, I will never doubt anything you tell me again, ever\\\". Not sure what he meant at the time, I asked him what happened, he quietly turned and pointed, saying \\\"someone or something was standing on the other side of the creek watching me pee\\\". It was obvious he was actually scared speechless. I grabbed a spotlight and we all walked down to the spot where he was standing. As I was hitting the treeline with the light there was no sight of any movements, eyeshine or anything so I stepped as close to the waters edge as I could. As soon as I turned the light back on and the beam hit the other side of the creek, we heard a loud grunt, almost similar to a pig, I panned to our left and that's when it all happened. A large bipedal, hair covered animal stood up from behind a group of palmetto bushes. It stood fully erect, the light shine of the eyes were almost gold, it reacted to the light hitting its eyes like a person would, by throwing it's forearm up in front of its face, let out a chilling sound (not a grunt, more like a short howl) unlike anything any of us had heard, it then turned and fled, vanishing like before. All of that happened in just seconds and all four of us witnessed it. We immediately packed up our gear, went to a motel and stayed at the motel until the job was finished. Three of us later went to the FL fish and wildlife office and reported what we had seen. It was during that report when I first heard the term \\\"skunk ape\\\" or even that there had been other sightings of this type. I can honestly tell you, without any doubt, it was not mistaken identity. I grew up as a hunter and outdoorsman and I know what bears look like and also how they act in the wild, it was not a bear, it was definately a primate of some type.

The entire structure was composed of 6 broken trees and 3 broken branches (this is not including the \\\"base\\\" tree). One of the details of the structure that really stood out to me was the single tree that was bent down, twisted between two trees that were still standing, and then added into the main structure.

I have not discussed it with my wife, my best friend, or any other person close to me in my life. I was fortunate to have a coworker who had, many years ago, shared a similar personal experience that he had in Utah. He is the only person with whom I have shared my experience. I also want to say that what I am about to describe to you has tormented me for the last several months. I cannot emphasize enough how this encounter has affected me emotionally. Thanks to the encouragement of a fantastic confidant, I am now coming forward to report the incident as a step toward putting it behind me and getting on with my life. I did not ask for this, and had the event been within my control, I would have absolutely chosen not to have the experience. My life was perfectly fine with my previous view of reality, as incomplete and skewed as it may have been. I grew up in a very rural setting, and have always loved the outdoors and being in nature. I love to spend time in the beautiful wetlands and forests of Florida\\u2019s vast uninhabited wilderness areas. Monday through Friday, I work as an executive in a very large multinational corporation based in Orlando, FL, and being shut up in an office building throughout the week makes me stir-crazy. My life is a very high-stress environment, with responsibilities that include a multi-million dollar P&L, and oversight of approximately 1,000 employees. My weekends are often spent decompressing in nature through hiking or canoeing, especially in the winter months when the temperature is more comfortable. On the morning of Sunday, January 15th, I was visiting friends in Lake Mack, FL, which is a very small community located in a rural area of Central Florida about 10 miles west of Deland, FL, and about 30 miles from my home. To get to this area, go west on HW 44 out of Deland. Highway 44 will curve south just before the drawbridge that crosses the St. Johns River. The Pier 44 Marina will be on the left and is visible from the drawbridge. Immediately after crossing the drawbridge from Volusia into Lake County, turn right onto County Road 42 and continue west for about four miles. If approaching on the westbound side of the road, the Lake Mack community will be located on the south (left) side of CR 42, and the Ocala National Forest on the north (right). CR 42 traverses the southern edge of the 600 square mile Ocala National Forest. Having never been to Lake Mack prior to the 15th, I had earlier looked at the Google Maps application installed on my Blackberry to get directions. I noticed that the Ocala National Forest was just across the road, and saw that there were several forest service roads that crisscrossed the southern portion of the forest. I decided that after my visit, I would go drive through the forest and possibly do some exploring and hiking. I finished up in Lake Mack about noon and drove west on CR 42 for about 1 mile, and turned right onto Deerhaven Road and proceeded north into the forest. Deerhaven Road is paved for about the first 2 or 3 miles until it turns into National Forest Service Road 420, which to my surprise was a one-lane, very bumpy, unpaved road. Initially, I was very nervous about continuing, but the dirt-road was compacted and my car appeared to handle it with no problems. Feeling a bit more comfortable, I continued deeper into the woods. I drove for what I would estimate to be another 3 miles or so. The road passed through an area that appeared to have been burned in the past by a forest fire, as most of the pines were dead and only a very thick 3 to 5 ft layer of saw palmetto and other scrubby bushes covered the ground. In this area, the visibility was better due to the lack of a forest canopy and I could see the forest line about a mile in the distance. At this point, the road was still good, and so I continued driving until I the road left the burned zone and entered the tree line into a heavily forested area. I would estimate that after about \\u00bd to 1 mile into the forested area, I started to notice an increasing amount of soft sand in the road rather than the hardened more compacted dirt that I had been driving on previously. I got nervous and decided to turn around and go back out of the forest on NFS 420 the same way that I had entered. At that moment I felt the car sink into sand. I quickly steered left up on the side of the road so that I could get turned around. I was able to get the car turned around in the opposite direction, but when I moved forward about a foot, the car sank deep in the sand. I tried for some period of time to get unstuck, but ended up only digging the tires deeper into the sand. It dawned on me what a stupid idea it was to bring a car into the backcountry\\u2014lesson learned. So here I was, in one of the wildest and most remote areas in the State of Florida completely stranded and all alone. I decided to try to dig out the wheels. I was down on my knees next to the front driver\\u2019s side tire digging the sand with my hands. After a few minutes of this, I stood upright to stretch my back out of the hunched position I had been in. When I stood up, a rock pelted me and a shooting pain went through the inside of my left thigh near the groin area, which caused me to jump back and yelp in pain. Because I was leaning forward against the fender of the car, the rock bounced off my leg and onto the hood of the car, and then slid slowly down the hood and into the sand, which, to my relief, told me that it was not a bullet or snakebite. I immediately looked toward the forest on the other side of the road from where the rock came, and perceived movement in the bushes. At this point, I did not see the creature, but did see movement in the branches and leaves of the shrubs, grasses and saw palmetto. The movement was enough to convince me that someone or something was there, and that it\\u2014whatever it was\\u2014was the source of the rock. Unsure of what to do, I stood there for about 30 seconds and checked my surroundings, including the road to the east and west, and the forest that was immediately behind me. After I turned back from looking into the trees behind me, I heard movement in the forest behind me. The sound that I heard was the sound of leaves and sticks being crushed on the ground, as if someone took one step and then stopped. The sound appeared to come from about 15 feet in the woods behind me. So now at this point, I had perceived movement in the woods on both sides of the road immediately in front of and behind me. I looked back again into the trees behind me where the noise originated, but saw nothing. At this point, the fear struck me pretty hard. Several things crossed my mind, such as wild hogs, bears and coyotes. But none of those animals obviously, to my knowledge, were capable of throwing rocks. Then the thought crossed my mind that perhaps there were a couple of people who had decided to have a little fun at my expense.  So, I called out into the forest, \\u201cWho\\u2019s there? This isn\\u2019t funny. I need help getting my car out of the sand. Please help me,\\u201d and so on. I heard nothing in reply and saw no movement. With the fear mounting and my thoughts turning more toward protection rather than getting my car unstuck, I remembered that I had a can of UDAP in my backpack in the trunk. The previous summer, I had hiked part of the Appalachian Trail in Tennessee and North Carolina and had purchased a couple of cans of UDAP for that trip. I walked around the back of the car, opened the trunk and pulled out my backpack. When I slammed the trunk shut, I again heard movement in the trees on the south side of the road and the location from which the rock had been thrown. I looked to my right and began unzipping the backpack when the creature started to make a hissing sound, though up to this point I still had not visually identified the animal. It was a very loud hissing sound, similar to what you might hear from a feral cat that is being cornered, only much, much louder and deeper. It then started to alternate between a hiss and a vocalization that sounded like \\u201chaaaaawwwww\\u201d. So the sound it was making was a protracted \\u201chhhiiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwww, hhhiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwwww,\\u201d with an intermittent deeper gurgling sound interspersed throughout. Hearing this put me into flight mode, and I immediately got in the car and locked the doors. When I slammed the door, I looked across the passenger seat out through the passenger side window and saw the creature about 15 feet into the woods as it got up and stood up on two legs. It was out of view previously, as I was able to later conclude, because it had been in a completely prostate position in or behind about 3 or 4 feet of saw palmetto. I saw its head rise up first, then its back, then it appeared to go to all fours, and finally pushed itself up with its long arms onto two legs. I briefly saw its side profile as it did not turn and face me directly, but rather stood up facing east in parallel to the road. Once it rose up completely on two legs, its head was obscured by the tree branches above, while at the same time, its feet and legs were obscured by the saw palmetto and other bushes below. So, at this point, I was looking at its torso through about a 3 to 4 foot clearing between the scrub below and the branches above. To say the least, I was completely petrified. I was locked in my car, but absolutely did not feel safe at all. I would estimate that the creature was about 8 feet tall. It was extremely bulky across the bust, with very muscular arms, and I have no doubt that it could have easily busted out the windows and ripped me to shreds if it so desired. It stood there for what I would estimate to be about 3 seconds. I also observed what would commonly be described as a \\u201clove-handle\\u201d, around the side of the belly area and back. The creature\\u2019s hair was black and gray in color and was slicked down against the lighter skin, which could be seen in some places through what appeared to be wet hair. The hair was very thick on the arms and shoulders but less so around the side belly and back areas. It appeared to be wet because the hair was slicked down against the skin. After standing there for approximately three seconds, it hunched forward and walked east in parallel to the road and was immediately out of sight in the trees. Just before the first step, when the creature hunched forward, it put its hands forward to grab onto some branches, which allowed me to get a glimpse of its right hand. From what I could see, the top of the hand and arm was very hairy. It had about 3 inches of hair hanging down from the wrist area that was longer than the rest of the hair on its arm. One thing that stood out to me: when the arm swung up, I noticed the palm area was much lighter than the rest of the arm, almost a light grey or even off-white color, which was in stark contrast to the much darker hair that covered the other areas of the arm, torso and back. As it swam through the bushes, I could see the trees move and shake as it moved forward through the woods along the side of the road. It walked through the scrub for what I would estimate to be about 15 or 20 feet, and then stopped, again completely obscured from my view. Also, the hissing and other vocalization had stopped at this point and everything was completely quiet. After about a minute had passed of no further movement, I saw a tiny dark portion of the creature peek out from behind a pine tree that was growing near the side of the road about 15 or 20 feet in front of me. I could not perceive any detail at this point whatsoever, just that it was hiding and peaking from behind the tree. It appeared to be crouching down because the peek appeared about 3 or maybe 4 feet up the side of the pine tree from the base of the tree on the ground. It was obvious to me that the creature had previously responded to the slamming of the car door and trunk. Not knowing what else to do, I laid down on the horn and started opening and slamming shut the driver\\u2019s side door hoping that such nuisance noises would drive it out of the area. It did in fact evoke a response, but not the one I was hoping for. After about 15 seconds of door-slamming and horn-honking, the creature lumbered slowly on all fours in sort of a crouched position from behind the tree onto the side of the road right along the tree line. I quickly slammed the door shut. As soon as the door slammed, the creature reared back and flung a soft-ball sized amount of slimy brown, lumpy material that was about the consistency and color of \\u201cwet\\u201d peanut butter all over the hood of the car. It slid down the hood and onto the sand in front of the car, leaving a wet residue on the hood. It then put its arms forward, moving out of the crouched position, and then quickly crossed the road in front of me using both its arms and legs to walk on all fours, just like a four-legged animal. It looked back at me briefly and then disappeared into the tree line on the opposite side of the road. One thing I noticed at this point is that the creature was completely soaking wet from head to toe. When it flung the material at the car, I saw water drops shake off of the arm. It was very wet with the hair laying slicked to the skin, much like what you might see with a wet, long-haired dog. The face of the creature was a dark grey color, with very large dark eyes. It had a very large mouth with extremely large, fat lips. The nose was human-like, with one exception, which was large, slightly flared nostrils. The nose did not protrude off its face in proportion to a human\\u2019s, but was flatter and more sunken. The creature looked like an ape, but with facial features\\u2014especially the nasal area\\u2014that were very similar to those of humans. I resumed honking the horn, but did not open the door because I did not have eye contact with it and further knew that it was now in the forest on the same side of the road where I was sitting in the driver\\u2019s seat. I did not want to give it the advantage of an open door should it decide to jump out of the woods to my immediate left and attack the car. About 1 minute after disappearing into the tree line, the creature reemerged, this time walking completely upright on two legs, just like a human. It paused at the tree line for a second, and then took one huge step back across the road. The creature, to my shock and horror, was carrying along a \\u201cchild\\u201d of the same creature. It had both arms of the smaller creature grasped in its right hand, and was dangling the juvenile along by its side, with the legs of the smaller creature almost touching the ground. The smaller creature appeared to be completely limp from the neck down, but its eyes were open and it was moving its head and looking toward the trees to which it was being carried. After crossing the road, the creature paused at the tree line on the opposite side of the road, lifted the juvenile up onto its hip, and continued into the scrub. Just before disappearing, the small creature wrapped its legs around the back and stomach and clung to the creature\\u2019s chest with its arms. Basically, it was carrying the smaller creature in the same way that a human would carry a child on the hip. It did not reemerge from that point forward, nor did I see any sign or hint of it again. I would estimate that the smaller creature was about three feet tall. It was also a different color than the adult, with the child being more of a light brown, with possibly some hints of a red and blonde, versus the black and grey color of the adult. One thing that stood out about the child is that it appeared to be very, very thin, almost to the point of appearing emaciated. I could actually see the outline of the ribs through the skin and hair that covered it. I sat petrified in my car for about an hour until I looked up and saw two hunters driving Jeeps down the road toward me. They were kind enough to pull my car out of the sand, and quickly got me going on my way out of the forest. Once I got on HWY 44, I left the area at about 85 mph and never looked back.

We are both well acquainted with the noises that the native animals make, what we heard that night while camping was not anything that either of us had ever heard before. I am not in a hurry to ever hear again. The location of the vocalization was approximatley 15 to 20 miles from I-75 going east on SR 82. I lived off of Shawnee trail back then and hiked the cypress swamps every chance I got. I knew the area well back then having hunted deer and hog all over that area.

We had to wade quite a bit of wet area to find a suitable dry place to set up camp. I lived about 1 and 1/2 miles off of S.R.82 and where we were camping then was probably another 3 or 4 miles back in the swamp. We had just gotten a fire going and it was quite dark by now. We were sitting by the fire when we both heard a deep scream coming from out of the swamps. It was like no sound I have ever heard. It was deep and drawn out and echoed back through the swamps. I am not exagerating when I tell you that even the bugs got quiet. Bill looked at me and said, \\\"What the hell was that?\\\"  I said \\\"I dont know but I'm going home.\\\"  We broke camp and left. Neither of us was carrying a weapon during that trip. I dont think I would have shot what ever it was that made that noise, but I don't ever go to the woods now without a gun. I can also provide you with Bill's contact info so you can ask him about it. We did not see anything nor smell anything just heard the one scream. I would estimate the creature was within 1 mile or less of us.  I have told my parents about this. They said it may have been a gator or panther but I know what those animals sound like.

The first, that after reading one of your articles, I now feel very strongly that I was being followed by a \\\"Bigfoot.\\\"  I lived on about 100 acres that butted up to Cecil Webb (a Game Reserve of apprx. 15,000 acres, in Charlotte County, FL.) A friend and I were taking a nighttime horseback ride down the dirt road that I lived off of.  There where large ditches on both sides of the road, with woods and cattle pastures, all up and down this road, which was probably about 10 miles long. She and I were talking about what 15 year old girls talk about, when our horses started acting spooked and getting very nervous.  Shortly thereafter, I noticed that something was walking along side of us in the woods on the other side of the ditch.  I could only hear it because there was not quite half a moon and it was a cloudy night.  I knew that there was a cattle pasture there and at first dismissed it as maybe being a cow, which would have odd seeings that cattle usually run in the other direction when seeing a person on horseback, but it was possible.  But the pattern in which it moved didn't sound like a cow, the area was pretty thick with trees, palmettos and such and whatever it was had no problem staying right with us and we were on open land.  We weren't really scared yet, but we picked up our horse's pace a little and began to gallop, I knew there was a cross section coming up in the fence and figured whatever it was would be stopped there.  My girlfriend and I had our horses in a pretty good gallop at this point, but we were extermely shaken after passing the cross-section of fence and it was still there.  It seemed as though it never missed a stride.  At this point we both let out screams and were now at a full run, crossing several more fence lines, only to have it stay right with us.  It only stopped when we reached the edge of my property and it was no longer wooded.  By the time my parents calmed down two screaming, crying, freaked out teenage girls, we went out in the truck and saw where something had been, but never saw what it was.

On the corner was a street light that usually lit up my bedroom, which I shared with my younger sister and my grandmother. It was around 10pm, and I was in bed, trying to go to sleep. I was startled by some heavy footsteps outside on the grass and as I turned to the window I saw a huge shadow pass by as I continued hearing the footsteps. Whatever it was walked right past my window with a human-like walk. I couldn't make out what it was but it was not any four-legged animal, such as a cow.

My wife's cousin lives in a in a house in the ajacent property with Oaks covering a good bit of it but cleared under the trees. On a previous Previous trip out to my mother-inlaws land I in stalled a tempory gate in the barbed wire fence. This time out I hired a friend's 15 year old son  to help haul branches that I was cutting back to a clearing In the middle of the property to be burned at a later date. I cleared and he hauled for a few hours, after a while I noticed that he was getting tired and it was starting to get later in the day. around 5:00-5:30 PM so decided to stop clearing and help him carry the branches back. For a good bit of the time the cousins dog follow him back and forth as he hauled the branches. Anyway as we were walk back we came to a spot where the fence was pulled back between the two parcels and the dog came through the gap in the fence, at the moment coming out of what would be the back of the low swampy area was three whoops. The first one was long and drawn out the two that followed were short. A chill ran down my spine as my mind was trying to place a animal to the sound. It was too loud and too deep to have come from an owl. What ever it came from it came from a large chest. At this point I did think Bigfoot and looked down at the dog but she was calm and seemed happy. I then looked back at the area that the whoops came from and there was a squirrel sitting on a downed palm flicking its tail. This made me dismiss the Bigfoot idea. I immediately asked the boy if he had heard that. The thing is theres no way anyone could have missed it, it was so loud. then he said he heard it on one of his previous trips back. For days I racked my brain for what could have been I have been hiking in the woods and swamps of Florida all my life and know the sounds of the local wild life and couldn't come up with anything that fits the bill. It did sound alot like the Howler Monkeys I've heard in zoos, but the tone was way too deep to be a Howler Monkey. About a week later I was out with a cotractor to talk about putting in a drive back to where the house is to bee built. He also has been in Florida a long time, so told him of the noise I heard and asked him if he could tink of any animal that could have made that sound and he said a Whooping Crain. I said oh! yah that must be it. I went home satisfied with that answer. About week later I was poking around the internet and I looked up info on Whooping Crains and there was recordings on the site I found. When I played the track a chill ran through me not because it was the sound I heard but because it wasn't. I thought about sending a report in for months now, but because of being so unsure of what I heard I held back. Well today I was at my daughters babyshower and the cousin was there for some reason my 12 year old decided that it was a good time to blurt out I saw a Bigfoot, correcting him I said I heard a noise, and of course he said that I heard a Bigfoot I again corrected him and said that I didn't know what it was and elaberated that it was out on the property. At this point the cousin became very interested and asked what it sounded like, so I imitated whoops for her at that she said that she had been hearing strange sounds out there too. I asked if they were whooping and she said yes but there was other sounds to it also she said screaming and whooping I ask if it sounded like a woman screaming and she said kind of but not exactly.

I didn't pay it too much attention thinking it was a Raccoon which I had seen earlier. I heard the noise in the swamp again only louder and closer so I stood up to see what it was. I saw a large figure standing behind about a 5 - 6 ft. palm tree. I couldn't make out what it was so I walked up closer when I saw him turn towards me face to face and only about 15 feet away.

Hard to tell the exact color because it was dark except for the light outside on the house, but it did appear to be a darkish brown color, I am guessing over six foot tall because he stood over the Palm tree about a head length. Directly in line with this small ditch or canal are the Railroad tracks leading across the Caloosahatchee River and back into the wilderness and forest or swamps.

The other looked like it might be passable, as far as I could tell. At 1 a.m. I was sitting on the tailgate and my girlfriend a few feet away tending the fire. Then we heard a loud high-pitched scream that reverberated through the dense forest. My girlfriend got scared and asked me what it was. I have been an outdoorsman my whole life, hunting, fishing, camping, and studying animals like a religion. I've never heard anything like that scream. I told my girlfriend to be quiet, maybe it would go off again. The moon was high and bright to be not full yet. The trail was lit good, so i looked down the trail and i looked the way we came. In the middle of the trail a large, bulky figure stood! The way the light fell on its features I believe it was facing me from about 30 yards distant. I thought at first it might be a tree or bush, but it had a discernable head, arms, torso, and legs. I went and got my girlfriend, not saying anything to upset her.

Just outside of Helen off of s.r.75 north of the Upper Chattahoochee River Recreation Area. If you go to the top of the mountain north of the park clearing thats where my experience was. I had my first experience there in the year 1990. While a group of 5 friends and I were walking late at night we saw something on a near by ridge it stood up clearly visible but only as a sillouette in the moon light and jumped a very large distance. It then seem to stride over the back side of the ridge away from us. It was actually very quiet it didnt make a sound before we saw it stand and we didnt hear it land or stride away, as if it was stalking or observing us! Of course we were all extremely scared after seeing it initially. Again it was at night, and far away so we couldnt get a clear description. But we all saw it and were all struck with a panic like fear! I also went back with my dad who is a very harsh skeptic in the summer of 2006. We did not \\\"see\\\" anything but I had noted a couple of other things at this later date it was summer. First there was a very strong odor that seem to hang in a centralized area the entire weekend. Secondly the park rangers came by to tell us that the night before in the same place we were camping the last people left food out went into town after night fall and returned to find the camp completely ransacked so we needed to pack our food up or better yet keep it in the vehicles back on the road. They said the bears were forageing and getting brave because of the onset of the drought. Again no sightings but interesting because nobody actually spotted the \\\"bear\\\" either! And lastly along the mountain road at a heigth of 9-10 feet off the ground there was a 4 inch sappling rung and twisted completely around! My dad once spent 3 months in the woods living off the land in the late seventies in north Georgia. Its the number one reason he is skeptical he says that long in the woods and he would have seen something if it was out there. But when I noticed the odor and asked him if it was skunk, he said no not really, more likely a wet bear that got sprayed by a skunk but it had a more dank odor than just skunk. And also when I pointed out the rung tree and asked him what could have possibly caused that he had no clue!  I work in agricultural marketing. My job is to determine the amount of meat that will be derived from individual cow carcasses after slaughter and before they are split into primal cuts. To determine this we have to compare the confirmation of the animal or the ratio of muscling to fat and factor in the skeletal structure of the animal. So if I apply this to what I remember seeing when I was younger this creature was absolutely huge at least 8 feet tall and weighing easily 550 pounds! It was tall but had a slightly more narrow build in shoulder area width than the animal in the Patterson film. It was still too large to be human, wider and thicker muscled than a man but not as stocky as the Patterson footage, that is why I say it may not be heavier.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Helen\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"S.R. 75\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Pine trees.

We filled up the truck and headed back up towards Raven Cliff to find a camp site for the night.  We found a small dirt road that had been barricaded with a large dirt birm.  We drove over the birm and drove into the forest.  We drove until we had a half tank of gas which put us several miles back in.

We gathered wood for a fire and began to set up camp.  Since the weather was nice, we decided to not to mess with tents and hammocks.

A medium to light brown. He looked healthy. It was his eyes that I remember most. He looked at me with an  intelligence that you don't see in an animal. The only other time I experienced that was with a dolphin. I contacted DNR the next day. They had not received other sightings. I know the lady that submitted your .

Sure, I had heard of the skunk ape, but was never concerned. Being a boy, I was adventurous. Anyways, we were in the pasture hiking when we found an old tractor trailer. The trailers doors were missing, the were off and lying rotten on the ground, (with trees growing in them). We noticed that the trailer smelled real bad. We decided to climb in and look around. All we found was stench, like an animal lived in there. We were too far from the road for a bum to wander in and there wasn't any sign that anyone \\\"kept the place up\\\". We lost interest in the trailer and started to hike some more. We came upon a canal that forked with another one. To make a long story shorter, I saw something looking at us from across the canal.

I first encountered \\\"something\\\" in the spring of 1994 when camping with a group of friends in the woods bordered by Lyons rd to the west, the Florida Turnpike to the east, Sample road to the south, and the Winston Park development to the north. I left the camp alone at about 1:00 am heading east, towards the Turnpike on a trail. I began to hear what seemed to be footsteps in the woods maybe 5 - 10 yards to my right. I'd also like to say that I smelled a musty odor, but I could be inserting that into the report - it's been awhile since I had the encounter, and my recollection isn't as clear as I wish it were. Regardless I continued to walk, and the footsteps were remaining parallel with mine, and it bacame clear that whatever was two my right was walking on two feet from the stepping pattern. I started to get a little frightened, because the area where the footsteps were coming from was a thicket of Brazilian peppers - difficult to walk through during the day, and nearly impossible to manage in the night. I heard it move closer, and I turned around, and walked briskly back to camp. I woke my friends, and we went back to find it, although it was gone at the time. I remember leaving with the impression that I had encountered a sasquatch (which must be because of the scent), although I wrote it off as a figment of my imagination - that it must've been a farmer or a vagrant in the woods. I preceeded to forget about the incident, and never mentioned it again. About six months later, my brother was in the same woods, maybe a half mile from where I had my \\\"encounter,\\\" walking at night with a friend. He turned a corner from one trail to another, and \\\"bigfoot\\\" was standing at the intersection of the two trails. He said that it had reached out for him, and he and his friend ran off. He told me about the experience, and I then related mine. We had a running joke for awhile that there was a \\\"monster in our backyard.\\\" I'd like to be able to have my brother provide his report, since he had a sighting and is a better and more credible witness than I am, but he passed away at the end of 95 (I believe I might be able to find the friend, however) Regardless, I wanted to report the incident for a few reasons - first - it's a very unusual area to encounter an creature like this - the area is surrounded on all sides by a significant amount of development. While there remained a good deal of open land, including a tomato farm, a tree farm, Tradewinds Park, and some undeveloped land, it didn't strike me as being an area where one would have thought to find a creature like this - there doesn't seem to be too terribly far for this thing to go without being spotted. Further, given the amount of development that has gone into the area since, its range is becoming severely limited. Still, the 1975 Broward report happened about a mile or two west of where my brother and I saw it, so it must have found a way to adapt. It's possible it could move along the turnpike and the sawgrass expressway somewhat unnoticed, making it over to the nearby landfill, as well as Quiet Waters Park, although it appears unlikely that it could've gone too much further without being caught in the middle of suburbia. Given the amount of development that has since gone into the area, it's range is further being restricted. It might be a very lucrative area to investigate. At the rate development is going, if it still back there, it's going to be encroached upon sometime soon.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Coconut Creek/Coral Springs\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Florida Turnpike and Lyons Road\", \"COUNTY\": \"Broward County\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"I don't know the lighting when my brother encountered it - he said it was dark.\", \"YEAR\": \"1994\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"Lyons halfway between Sample and Hillsboro, roughly where the Wiles rioad extension is being built.\", \"SEASON\": \"Fall\"},\n",

We lived so close to the Glades my friends and I used to ride our skateboards to the levy and watch the Everglades burn (at that time, some firebug had set quite a blaze). On some mornings we'd wake to cars and yards covered in ash. Needless to say, a lot of wildlife began to migrate closer to our neighborhood i.e.,deer,alligators, whatever. One night we pitched a tent in my friends back yard approx.  50 yrds from a canal that separated us from an apartment complex and across from that was the beginning of the everglades. The fires had been raging for weeks and people in the area were reporting missing pets, some of which were inside 6 foot privacy fences. We used to run between houses to cut through to go home. This night in particular, before we called it quits, we played a bit of hide and seek. I remeber hiding under a window box behind a bush and got spotted by an unmarked police car. We really thought we were in trouble, but the police were looking for a person that had been peeping in windows. We assured the police we weren't the perps and went on about our business and went to the tent. 3 kids in a tent don't sleep well, so we were having fun cracking jokes and noticed a sound coming from across the canal approx 100 yrds away. Something was slamming the dumpster lids in the complex across the way and making low deep sounds, grunts. These were tall dumpsters. You'd have to get a boost to lift the lid. We got real quiet trying to listen to figure what it could be. At first we figured a cow got loose and possibly was bumping into the dumpster. But, it became evident that wasn't so. One of the kids I was with turned on a flashlight and started making shadow puppets with his E.T. stuffed animal. Then the thing from across the canal took notice of us for the first time. The grunts were still audible but with what I would say is with a hint of curiosity. We got quiet and real concerned putting 2 and 2 together. Could this be what the police were looking for? The steps grew closer and closer. I remember we tried to figure if it was a quadraped or biped. When the steps finally stopped, the breathing grew louder, then SPLASH!!! Whatever it was was 50 yrds from us and coming right in our direction. We sprinted for the house waking up my friend's family. They were woken by 3 screaming kids at 2a.m. exclaiming something is out there. His dad grabbed his shotgun, turned on the flood lights.  He went out to look around and found the tent was demolished and covered in water. I swear I could feel this thing  right around the corner in the shadows looking right at us. We did not let his father investigate further until morning and couldn't beleive the tent had been moved from its postion. I have no doubt had we stayed in that tent this story would be much different, if at all.

We had moved from Ft. Lauderdale and would frequently exercise, bike ride, walk, run or rollerblade.  It was January 2001 or 2002, sunny day, a cold front just went through the area.  It was mid-afternoon, about 65 degrees, wind was out of the North, North East.  I even remember what I was wearing.  My wife and I decided to go Rollerblading that day, and we had a basic route we skated.  As we made our way away from our house we got to one of our favorite roads, Koala, and proceeded down to the end at an easy pace.  About 2-3 blocks from the intersection of Koala and Collingswood we stopped and saw what I first thought was a very large dog, on all four legs, in the swale about 20 ft. from the intersection.  I looked at the animal and I thought I was looking at the profile of a dog, a really BIG dog.  Although I did not see a tail or a head I did not give it another thought.  I remember saying to my wife, \\\"We should have brought a lead to see if someone lost a dog.  I would hate to see it get hit\\u201d.  As she was agreeing with me, we just started to move towards the animal and all of a sudden its head rose up and stared right at us.  The animal was not in the swale in a profile view on all fours, it was on all fours facing us.  It had a dark face which did not register with me.  The hair was long, reddish-brown.   As the animal looked up at us there was about a 2 second delay before it took off at an alarming pace.  RIGHT FOR US. Fight or flight sense kicked in. It started running, I looked at it as it gained speed and its hair was flowing in the breeze, there was no standard locomotive process.  It seemed to float.  The shoulders did not break a plane.  We turned around and started to get the heck out of there.  We feared that this animal was after us.  As I kept checking back at it, thinking I may have to confront it, I saw it move from the swale to the roadway effortlessly.  Again it appeared to float up the bank to the road.  Once in the road I could see the hair moving in the wind as it chased after us, I could see the front legs moving but the shoulders never broke a visual horizontal plane.  It took up a quarter of the roadway,  3-4 feet across, I would estimate 4-5 foot at the shoulder.  The animal drifted off into the woods to the north side in to an area that appeared to have been an opening made through the brush.   Maybe we were too close to its lair.  I don\\u2019t know.  I do not know what it was, I thought perhaps at first it was a dog, then maybe an exotic large cat, or a bear but I ruled them out just due to the unbelievable speed, overall size (huge) and locomotive process this animal executed.

Near the end of the tour about two miles from the ranch\\u2019s bunk houses and barns,  the driver had to tap his breaks to avoid a family of wild hogs (2 large and 3 small).

I got out and walked to the other side of the suv to get my stuff out, before I could do that I heard something jump out of the bushes behind me. I stood motionless and a strong smell of defecation was there. I talked about the smell and it disappeared. I opened the door and got my flashlight to see what was there and it was gone. By the time daylight rolled around there was six or so more cars that had come through and wipe out all tracks that I could have found. This was the first of 5 incidents of it.   2. Two weeks later I moved my stand to a different area due to all the other hunters. I went out an hour before daylight again and parked got in my stand and waiting for daylight. Right before daylight I heard a call unlike anything I have ever heard before. I have heard hogs, deer, and all other types of animal calls including bears. This call was not like any of them. As the morning went by more cars and hunters came into the area. I heard something big running towards me and it sat down 20 to 30 feet in front of me on the only blind spot I had. I waited for about ten minutes and figured another hunter had sat there, so I cleared my throat to see if it was human and it got up and ran off real fast. I couldn't see it. 3. Two or three weeks later I decide to go fishing at the gulf and was driving past the area I hunted at when out of the wood line a big hairy, black bigfoot ran in front of me with my bright lights on.

It was around 10:20 in the morning when we decided to meet back up and do some scouting for our last afternoon hunt on my quota. I had set my friend up a few hundred yards or so from Hwy 44 in the morning before daylight and I continued on for about 3/4-1 mi. on the edge of the swamp we were hunting. As I continued on I jumped something that ran off and sounded unlike a deer or hog but didn't think anything of it. We were sitting on ground. After we met up we started walking back towards the truck and saw a couple of wet areas (puddles) when I said to my friend, let me check and see if there are any prints leading to the water to get a drink. As I walked over there to see I looked down and noticed something out of the ordinary. I called my friend over to show him. It was a footprint, similar to a humans. Not real large but kind of wide for the length of it. It was so fresh that you could still see the thermal lines in the mud from the bottom of the foot. It was the only one that we could really make out. The heal and ball made deep impressions while the toes were not really deep in the mud in comparison. I had my cell phone with me so I took two photos of the print and one of the area we were in then he marked a tree next to it so we could find it again. It just seemed very odd to find a print like that in the middle of a swamp! We returned after lunch for an afternoon hunt. I did notice one other thing with the squirrels after we returned. I didn't go as far this time, but I noticed the squirrels barking more than usual off in the distance. It is how they warn others of pending danger. As time went on they got closer and closer to where I was sitting and then all of a sudden went silent. Just an observation! I have spent most of my life in the woods in florida either hiking, biking or hunting this was the first time I noticed something like this. It is probably human but who would be out there barefoot??

The stretch of road was lightly scattered with houses, but had mostly dense wooded areas with an occasional cow pasture. The weather was clear with a light night fog. As we approach one of the more deserted areas along the road, I spotted something off to the right hand side of the road. At this point it was not clear as to what it was. I slowed down a bit thinking it may be a dog or animal. I've commonly seen many nocturnal animals along this stretch of road in the past. As we approached somewhat closer, it stepped out into the path of the car. We, at this time, were moving approximately 20 MPH as the animal came in to direct headlight. I was stunned to see that which I had assumed would be a raccoon, actually stood at least 6 to 7 feet tall, walked on two legs, and was covered with brown hair, (was somewhat skinny). I completely stopped the car as it crossed the road. A car coming in the opposite direction stopped as well. I almost could not come to terms with what my eyes were seeing. My oldest daughter, which was nine years old at the time, said \\\"oh my gosh! What is that?\\u201d It crossed the road quickly into the thick brush on the left hand side of the road. Once again she said \\\"Dad, what was that?\\\" I sat there with my mouth hanging open, then tried to think of what to say that wouldn\\u2019t spook her. We had just passed a cow pasture about 30 feet prior, so I babbled, \\\"I a...a...a think it was a cow.\\\" We drove silently for a few miles. The whole time I'm thinking to myself, \\\"You just saw a Skunk Ape\\\". She then turned to me and said, \\\" Dad, cows don't walk on two legs... Looked more like a Bigfoot to me.\\\" I stuck with my ridiculous \\\"cow story\\\" until she was much older. She's now 18 years old, and we've laughed about the cow story for years. These days we both use each other as our witness that on that April in 1994 we both did truly indeed see a Bigfoot. My youngest daughter was asleep in the back seat during the entire event.

Now I know this particular area and the wildlife that inhabits it pretty well I think, It is full of deer, wild boar, turkeys, a few black bears, and the rest of the small woodland critters.  And this sound was way too large to be any of them. Back to my story, after we heard the noise I motioned to my friend to be silent so I could trolling motor over to the bank so I could try to get a look.  As we were silently getting closer it seemed like the creature must have noticed us because we stuck out like a sore thumb against the back drop of the creek, while it stayed perfectly camoflauged in the wood.  We sat there for a few moments hoping it would move and reveal itself to us which it never did. So, as the sun was dropping we had to get back to the boat ramp, we quitely circled away from the shore.  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat. It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore.  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up, and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride.

As soon as the creature reached the tree line, it turned and squated facing us on the roof, about 40 yards away. The creature was about six feet tall, with reddish-brown hair all over it's body. It made no noise or other movement. This silent standoff continued until the creature suddenly stood and gazed far off to the west. It had heard our trucks arriving before we could even see them from the roof. The creature turned and had totally disappeared within just a few steps away from us.

I was looking down at the ground searching for hog tracks. I had seen a group of about 8 hogs approximately 45 minutes earlier, and was trying to outflank them. I looked up to see how close I was to the Bayhead, when I saw, what at first was just a dark object at the edge of the bayhead. My first thought was that it was a bear. I crouched down and started to advance in order to see it better, and, maybe get a shot at it. When I was approximately 80 to 100 yards away, it stood up on two feet. I froze solid, inside and out! What I saw was NO BEAR! It's back was to me at first, but after about five seconds, it turned to face me.

When my husband got to our shed he saw a large shadow up against the siding and it sounded as if our dog were being muffled. He ran back into our home thinking it was a bear or something to the effect and grabbed his gun. He then went back outside ( us trailing close behind him) and it appeared to him as if something were running down our driveway - in the meantime our dog was hidding underneath our home.

      "{\"REPORT_NUMBER\": \"720\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class A\", \"OTHER_WITNESSES\": \"hunting hogs and driving swamp buggies\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"swamp terrain with oak hammocks and cabbage palms\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"Several months after Hurricane Andrew struck south Florida, five friends and myself were on a hog hunting trip in an area just south east of the Big Cypress Indian Reservation. My friends had a camp there, along with other people who had been there for years. This area is a weekend get away spot were people go to hunt and camp. The area is very swampy and filled with many oak and cabbage palm hammocks and cypress heads. To get around the terrain you must have a four wheel drive swamp buggy with good clearance. On this particular day we had drove many hours in search of hog tracks. We used dogs to sniff out the hogs, by driving on the swamp buggy trails. I had noticed a certain trail that had not been used for quit some time and no visible buggy tracks. I came up to a big puddle in the road and notice that the animals in the area had been using it to drink from. I saw hog tracks, deer, turkey, raccons, birds. Noticing the hog tracks I drove completely around the pool of water to save this a as a marker to return later in the evening. Around midnight we drove two buggies into the area that I suspected hogs would be hiding from the midday sun. We drove all night crashing down palmetto bushes that had grown up in this area on the trails.  During this time no other human sign had been observed until the next day. At the pool of water where I saw the animal sign I returned and found some strange tracks. I appeared to be human shaped, bipedal. One was very big and the other very small like a child's or possibly deformed. The tracks had a stride of approximately six feet, with a depth of two to three inches . I tried to imitate the step and stride and could not. I would fall over and barely broke the surface of the mud a half inch. When I stomped my foot into the mud I still could not reach the depth of the suspicious tracks. I went back to the camp and told my friends what I had found. We then returned to the location later that evening and to my amazement new tracks were found. The  maker of the tracks had returned after my departure. It may be noted that myself and friends are veteran law enforcement officers who have seen it, done it and got a T-shirt . We don't believe what we hear and half of what we see. At this point we were very suspicious and concerned about what we had stirred up out of the swamp the night before. We had a 8 mm vhs camera and video taped the tracks and the comparison of our tracks. Three out of five of us believed that we had found the tracks of an escaped gorilla , being that the hurricane had damaged the Miami zoo and reports of escaped monkeys had been reported. Or the tracks of a skunk ape.  Being police officers you don't run back to town and tell everyone that you saw skunk ape tracks while on a vacation. We left the area in amazement and discussed the possibilities of it being a skunk ape. While riding back to camp approximately 3 miles from the suspicious track location on a hard dry road bed we found another set of tracks.  The track impressions were as deep as the ones found near the mud. At this time we were convinced that no human had made these tracks because of the lack of other vehicle tracks and the fact that someone walking 3 miles barefoot in this terrain with one bad foot was unlikely. We video taped this track spot as well. Upon returning home a couple of us were convinced that this needed further investigation.  I spoke with some of the old timers that had hunted this part of the country and they laughed about my tale.   Later in the spring I returned to the area to try to locate the tracks again so that I could take casts and photos if I found anything. The area was like what I had found prior to driving in the swamp months earlier, no tire tracks just the local inhabitants, hogs, deer ,turkey. These woods are thick and I do believe that an intelligent creature could sneak around undetected from civilized man. The land is rich with food and shelter. I have moved away from my home in the Glades and often wonder if I had scared a skunk ape from his hiding spot in that pristine oak hammock during the fall of 1993 or was it a prankster. We never told anyone out side our circle of friends and never read about mysterious tracks found in the Everglades and or spoke with anyone down there that might have seen the same tracks.

On Wednesday 7-16-97 around 2:00 pm, Goodbread was driving a tour bus, with a group of tourist, along  Turner Road.  Goodbread arrived at an area where there is a burned out wooden  bridge across the canal on the east side of the road.  Goodbread and the tourists observed a large brownish colored creature behind some brush near the bridge. The creature continually stood upright on two legs, was approximately 7' tall, had hair covering it's entire body (except for the face) and was rocking back & forth.  Goodbread advised that the creature resembled a gorilla. Goodbread indicated that the creature was shaking the bushes and appeared to be irritated by their presence. The creature was approximately 70 to 80 yards away. Goodbread continued to watch the creature for about 15 minutes.  Goodbread repeatedly eased the tour bus forward and backward so as to allow visibility, of the creature, to everyone on the bus. Goodbread attempted to get one of the tourist, with a telephoto lens on her camera, to exit the bus and take photographs of the creature. No on would get off the bus. Goodbread now feels that exiting the bus might have been a bad idea. Goodbread finally drove away, leaving the creature at this location.  Goodbread later returned to the area and found a road where he could drive into the swamp. Goodbread did not locate the creature again. Goodbread feels that the creature might have been a hoax but states that it would be nearly impossibly for a human to withstand the heat, at that time of day, in a suit. This is also an area that is heavily populated by alligators. Goodbread states that they have been observing a large number of  deer and hogs moving out of the swamp because of the high water. Goodbread feels that he is in a little disbelief of what he saw, although  he believes in the possible existence of the skunk ape, and prefers not to associate the creature with his tours. Dow Roland is a tour guide for Everglades Day Safari. Rowland was driving a tour bus on Friday 7-18-97  around 2:30 pm , with a group of tourist, along Turner Road. Roland observed a brownish colored bipedal creature about 300' west of the  road, at the edge of the brush. Roland described the creature as being  approximately 7' tall, long brown hair, standing upright when walking or  running, having a smooth face and resembling a gorilla.  Rowland's observation, of the creature, was brief before it ran into the brush. Rowland's initial thought was that it was someone in a gorilla suit playing a prank.  Rowland was on his return trip at the time of this sighting.  A few minutes later Rowland returned to the same area, on Turner Road, with another group of tourists. Rowland was near the area where he had first observed the creature. Rowland again observed the creature on the west side of Turner road. This time the creature was approximately 150' from the road and again the observation was brief before the creature ran into the brush. The creature appeared to act  nervous. Rowland believed this to be the same creature that he had previously observed. Rowland indicates that he was still shocked and  in disbelief that this could be a real creature. Rowland finished the tour without observing the creature again.  After completing the tour, Rowland retrieved his camera and returned to the area on Turner Road. Rowland drove up & down Turner Road but was unable to locate the creature. Rowland was driving south near the area of his other sightings, preparing to give up his search, when he observed a white convertible driving north. The convertible passed him and continued north bound.  Rowland looked in his rear view mirror and observed the convertible stop suddenly then drive off. In an instant Rowland observed the creature appear at the west edge of Turner Road, approximately where the convertible had stopped. Rowland turned around but the creature had again disappeared into the brush. Rowland was unable to locate the creature again. The next day, on Saturday 7-19-97, Rowland told David Shealy of  his observations. David Shealy is the owner/operator of the Florida Panther Gift Shop located on Highway U. S. 41 one mile west of Turner Road. Jan Brock is a Collier county realtor who lives in the area of Ochopee,  Florida.  On the morning of Monday 7-21-97 Brock was traveling south on Burns road, sometime just prior to 7:45 am, in route to work.  Brock traveled through this location just prior to Vince Doerr.  Brock was approximately 2 miles north of U. S. 41 when she observed a creature, that she indicated was approximately 1000 feet in front of her car, cross the road.  Brock first observed the creature at the west edge of the road.  The creature crossed the road, heading east, and disappeared into the thick brush and trees on the east side of Burns road.  Brock described the creature as about 7' tall, covered with a furry coat of thick dark brown hair and what appeared to be a patch of off-white or light colored hair on it's chest. Brock explained that she has often times traveled the roads, observed the wildlife, and has seen numerous animals in the Everglades.  Brock compared the light colored chest patch, on the creature, to similar coloration that she has observed on bears that have been laying on the local limestone roads.  Brock further explained that this creature was definitely not a bear, that it's legs were too long to be a bear and that it walked upright the entire time of her observation. Brock recalls that she noticed that the creature looked in her direction but she was too far away to view the physical characteristics of any facial features.  Brock drove to the location, where the creature had crossed, and stopped her car.   Brock rolled her window down part way but did not exit her vehicle.  Brock looked around for the creature and for signs of any footprints.  Brock was unable to observe any further signs of the creature.  Brock commented that she had heard of the pungent odor, reportedly emitted by the Florida skunk ape, but she did not smell anything abnormal.  Brock drove on to work without any other sightings.  Brock's family has owned property, in this area, for many years.  Brock used to bring her children, when they were young & before they built a house there, to the area for picnics and weekend camping trips.  This would have been in the late 1960s.  Brock explained that her children would often claim that they saw a bigfoot creatures around their property and in the swamps.  Brock advised that her family has never been bothered by the creatures.  Brock does believe that the creatures exist and does not fear them. On  7-21-97, Vince Doerr, driving south from his home toward U.S. highway 41 in route to work, observed a Skunk Ape cross the road approximately 600' to 800' in front of him. The creature was moving from east to west at a slow pace. The witness arrived at the crossing sight, exited his vehicle and took a photograph, of the creature, approximately 80 yards away in the swamp. The picture is of the rear and upper torso of the creature. The creature was approximately 7' tall, bulky, reddish dark brown in color and continuously walked upright.  This photo is not entirely clear, the alleged creature is circled in the center of the photo.  In the future the BFRO will be doing enhancements on the photo, we will update the report when the enhancements are complete.   David Shealy learned of fire chief Vince Doerr's sighting, and associated it with what Dow Roland had told him earlier.  On Thursday 7-24-97 Shealy went to the area, on Turner Road, where the creature had been observed. Shealy is a long time resident of the area and is familiar with the swamp. Shealy began searching the area.  He found, what he believed to be, hair on some brush. The brush was along side a path. The hair was brown  in color and approximately three inches in length. The hair was later lost. (The information can be explained by the researcher.) Shealy located several large tracks in the area. Shealy was able to take plaster casts of two of the tracks. The footprints measured  approximately 13.5\\\" in length, approximately 6\\\" in width at the toes and approximately 3\\\" in width at the heel. (The researcher, in this case, has examined and photographed the plaster casts.) A couple (names confidential) was out watching birds and wildlife when it began to get dark. The couple prepared to leave the area and turned on their headlights. They were traveling north on Turner road when they observed a creature cross the road approximately 100 to 200 yards in front of them... They drove to the area of the crossing and turned their vehicle towards the west side of the road, in the direction that the creature had traveled.. As they turned their car, the headlights caught an object about 30 yards from the west side of Turner road. As the couple looked closer, they realized that it was a very dark complexioned man-like creature that they described as being well over 7' tall, 300 to 400 pounds and looking like a linebacker for a football team.... The creature constantly kept it's back to the vehicle and moved out of the headlights... As the couple moved the car, to place the creature back in the headlights, it again moved out of the light... The couple became concerned and left the area... When the couple were asked about further details, of the creature, they advised that they never saw the face and were unable to advise as to body hair.  The couple reported this information to a local wildlife naturalist and tracker... The couple refused to give their names or any contact information, advising that they did not want to be harassed.\", \"SEASON\": \"Summer\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class A\"},\n",

Could it have been stalking a boar which was near by?\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"Over the years I have read stories in the Palm Beach Post.\", \"STATE\": \"Florida\", \"OBSERVED\": \"In may of 1973 I and my father were working for XXXXX XXXXXX Drywall in Boynton Beach, Florida. We had just finished a job and came into the office for a new assignment. Frank told us he had a \\\"special job\\\" and would consider it a favor if we did it. The developer of Boca Teeca had a couple of hunting cottages, in the everglades, and it wouldn't take us more than a couple of days. We would have to camp over since it was too far to drive and there wasn't any lodging around. Now my wife was over 7 months pregnant and I wasn't crazy about doing the job. However, Frank was persausive, \\\"If you want to continue working for me you'll do it!\\\" I didn't have health insurance and was making payments to Bethesda Hospital, in advance, for my wife's upcoming hospital stay. So I caved in and took the job. The next day we packed some camping gear in the station wagon. My idea of camping was a state park or KOA camp. We set off. The directions were simple: take the Florida Turnpike south and go west on Alligator Alley, about halfway across you will see a gravel road to the left. Pass it and take the next gravel road to the left. The work site would be halfway between Alligator Alley and the Tamiami Trail. Looking back I would say this would have put it in Collier County, Florida (the beginning of everglades country). We taveled miles and miles, under the hot sun, on Alligator Alley, for what seemed miles and miles of miles and miles. Coming to the second gravel road we turned left and traveled more miles and miles down a washboard gravel road. I had packed fishing gear and a .22 cal. magnum pistal (with holster) and two .30 cal.M1 carbines. A canal ran parralel to road and I had at least wanted to get my hook wet. I talked him into stopping for 15 mins. or so (to stretch our legs) and I dropped a line in the canal. It was full of alligator gar which were stacked up like cord wood. My father spotted a water moccasin on the other bank and I took my .22 mag, aimed behind the head, shot and took its head clean off. We started up again and after many more miles saw a sign \\\" XXX XXXXX Site.\\\" We arrived in the early afternoon. The two cottages turned out to be two houses. Each identical and 2 stories high. The developers had a drive made by dumping a pad of coarse gravel, about 2.5 to 3 feet high, about 300 yeards back into the swamp. At the end, and right, of each drive was a big square of gravel the houses were built on. This was going to be more than a 2 day job. We started taping the houses. While I was working I could hear something rummaging around out in the bush. I couldn't see anything but there was a strong odor similar to the pig farm next to my grandfather's farm (in Ohio). XXXXX XXXXXX had a reputation as being a boar hunter and I assumed it was a boar. We worked till dark and cleaned and packed up our tools. I had Dad start a camp fire on the part of the drive that went past the house (you had to do a 3 point turn in the car port area to turn around). I set up the cots and put on my holster and .22 mag revolver (just in case we encountered a charging boar). Dad brougt a slab of bacon (his idea of camp food). Oh well, he was doing the cooking. It smelled good too. One thing about Dad, he's  a master chef when it comes to ruff grub. We ate bacon and beans and home fries and then sat around the fire talking. The whole time I kept hearing the rummaging around in the everglades. The sound seemed to be getting nearer. It occurred to me if it were a wild boar, or anthing as larges as the sounds indicated, the .22 mag probably wouldn't be too effective. I decided to go get one of the carbines. As I stood up and started to go to the wagon I turned and saw two eyes staring from about 20 foot away. First thougt... an owl. But then I realized what I was looking at. I froze in my tracks. Next thought a bear. Only I was staring level in its eyes. I was on a gravel pad about 2.5 to 3 foot higher than it was. I am 5 foot 6 inches. My God... it was 8 to 9 foot tall. My hand went for my gun. I drew it and was going to fire. Only I realized if I shot this thing all I was going to do was really piss it off. Also, it wasn't acting threatening. It was just watching. It had a face more human than a bear or ape. Closer to an Australian aborriginal. I could also see its skin. It didn't have thick fur. It had sparse, long and whispy like strands. The hair was more like an orangutan. Only these were things I put together later. At the time I was just plain scared. As a Viet Nam verteran, with a purple heart, I wasn't overscared either. Let just say I had a strong sense of self preservation. I made a bee line for the house and momentarilly thought about stopping to get the carbine from the wagon. However, my feet took me into the house and up the stairwell. My Dad was hot on my heels. I went to the window which faced the camp fire. As I looked out the window I asked Dad, who was across the room, \\\"Did you see that?\\\" He said, \\\"No.\\\" I told him, \\\"then what the heck were you running for?\\\" He said, \\\"I saw you draw your gun, then didn't shoot and then run off. I figured you had a good reason.\\\" I told him, \\\"we need the carbines. You go out and get them and I will cover you.\\\" He wouldn't do it. Still looking out the window I noticed we left the slab of bacon on a log near the camp fire. Then I saw it come out of the brush. I told Dad, \\\"There it is. Come over here and look at it.\\\" He woudln't do it. I don't know if he could have got across the room in time any way. It crossed the viewable area, may 100 ft. in a few strides. As it walked it scooped up the slab of bacon. It didn't really bend over. It just dropped a shoulder slightly. It was walking upright the whole time. I might add it was walking, not running. It was casually strolling as if it didn't have a care in the world. It dawned on me that it didn't mean any harm. It justed wanted the bacon. Anyway I went to the wagon and got the carbines. Even though I wasn't sure what I saw and I concluded it didn't mean any harm I wasn't taking any chances. I told Dad we were going to take two hour watches. He decided to sleep first. I woke him up in two hours and told him to awaken me in two hours. I woke up in the morning and he was fast asleep. Whatever it was could have had us. If it had wanted to. The doors had not been installed yet. I went out and looked for tracks. Nothing on the gravel. I didn't expect any. I climbed down to the ground. I thought it would be soft. It was dry and there was a thick pad of pine needles. There were a few scruffed places but the distance between them looked too far apart to be foot steps. I thought about venturing out and looking for a soft spot but at the time I wasn't trying to prove anything but to myself. If my Dad wasn't such a chicken, and had seen it, then I would have been more resolved to look further. Only now I was beginning to wonder if I had imagined the whole thing. I really didn't make the connection until a few weeks after I came home and there was a newspaper article about Sasquatch sightings in the area I had been in. I just made a mental note to ask if any circus or zoo animals had escaped, in that area, and if so I would call and tell them what I saw. I am not relating this encounter to make you a true believer. At that time I know I saw something and this is a report on what I thought I saw. After 28 years I now question it myself. The more time that passes the sketchier the recollection is. I only offer this record in hopes it might help those who are seriously looking for it. I have one reservation.

That night for dinner we cooked chicken legs and turkey meatballs over the fire. My brother left the garbage bag hanging 10 feet away from us and we went to bed. 4am I awoke hearing this strange sound in the far distance sounding 3 miles away. The sound came closer and closer to the point i knew it was heading towards my campsite. I woke up my ex-boyfriend, then my brother in another tent. I said do you hear that sound? they said yes be quiet. The sound was a wailing sound with a heavy breath at the end. I thought it was an alien and my ex thought it was a monster. The sound was horrible, and it got closer and closer to the camp. I heard it go by my tent and head in the direction of my brothers to the side of it, then left and went down a trail path behind our tents. I got up and wanted to look out of the tent window but my ex grabbed me and said are you crazy. The next morning we woke up and talked about it and began to trace the direction where the monster walked. I looked down and found a footprint in the sandy trail it looked like a huge foot both wide and long. Both guys put their foot in the print and it was way bigger than their foot in width and length couldnt be a persons foot. It looked like 4 big toes. This wasn't there the day before. We went up the trail and saw a few more of the prints. When we went home a guy friend of my cousins was interested in this phenomena so i went back with him and showed him where it occured and the footprint but it had slightly been messed up. He took picture but it didn't come out good. I wanted to go back again that year but my ex, brother, and cousin said no way. my cousin said she would have to bring a gun if she ever did go back. This strange happening scared them to death. I did go back with my kids and we were fine, no noises heard that night.

At approximately 6:00A.M we left from Florida International University traveling west on the Tamiami Trail. The weather that day was relatively clear but as I mentioned we had a hurricane passing close to south Florida a few days earlier so everything was still quite humid and the winds were beginning to calm down at about 15 knots to the west. It was near the area of big cypress about 15 minutes from the worlds smallest post office, where the landscape had plenty of saw grass in shallow water and large trees at a distance of about a mile off the road where I saw a figure that seemed to be watching the road as we drove past. This creature was definitely not a person. I know that it was not a person because we had only seen about 5 cars in the entire length of the trip thus far. Whatever it was, it appeared to be large, at least the size of a person, but it was dark, with a wide body structure, and even from the distance at which I saw it (maybe 300-500 yards) it looked as if it was covered in hair. The creature was standing next to a palmetto, and we passed it quite quickly. about 10 seconds after we passed it It came to my attention that I should probably tell my friend to turn the car around to see if I could get a better look. We stopped, drove back to the site, and It was gone. But as I got down from the car there was a very strange smell in the air that was nothing like I had ever smelled before, almost like a wet dog that had been covered in eggs. My guess was that maybe the creature had crossed the road, heard our car and checked us out, and that it realized that it did not like us so much and simply crouched down and hid. Nobody else in the car saw the creature, I was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side, the front seat passenger was asleep and the driver was simply concentrating on the road. I only saw this thing for a few seconds but it left quite an impression on me. Before this I thought that stories about Bigfoot were interesting but I would dismiss them saying that I would believe it when I would see it. But after seeing how remote this area was and how large the Everglades really are, I am now certain that there is a possibility that there is something out there.Thank you for responding to my report and feel free to give me a call at your convenience, if I do not pick up the phone it is probably because I am in class so leave me a message and I will contact you as soon as I can.

Its been about 3 years now since my friend Dan and I saw it. We were walking along a dirt/road trail along the focka canal system to find a good bass spot, as we were walking I thought I saw large brownish colored legs ahead on the trail. I didnt say anything at first until Dan asked me if I saw that. I was stunned and replied \\\"Yea, Huge brown legs cross in front of us and he replied \\\" I thought it was just my eyes\\\". The sasquatch was in a group of trees next to the canal I guess checking us out. The reason I am saying this is because we heard and saw the branches in front of us russling. We were honestly scared and backed away slowly. Now Dan is a officer in the Navy now working I believe out of Miami. He is a very credible none bs type of person. I myself is a biologist and I am super observent of my surroundings. The only reason why we just saw the legs is because we were looking down in front of us so we didnt step on one of the resident water moccasins. Since then I have been going to the same location to try to see if \\\"its\\\" still there and yes \\\"it\\\" is. I havent seen it since the first time but I found an area off the trail that had almost like I guess beds?!? Basically it was long saw grass bundled up together and it was obvious something large has sat in it. Also near by I found skelatal remains and hair from a bear that seemed to literally have been ripped in half. I have also spent many nights fishing in the location and near it and have heard undeniable 'calls\\\" that seem like it came from some sort of primate. Similar to a very deep howler monkey call.  I have a lot of experience with primates from my studies throughout Latin America. Based on that I KNOW it was a primate call. There was another occurence when I was with my friend Chris on Turner River Rd. off Rt.41 South of Ochopee,Fl. We were crawfish hunting after a evening shower and heard some odd noises in the woods across the canal system. Then we smelt a very odd odor I wouldnt say it smelt like rotten eggs like all the other reports but maybe like methane gas. We moved on about 2 miles down the road and was picking more crawfish out of the swamp and heard the same noises followed by the same smell. This occured for another 30 minutes or so and we felt uncomfortable and left. I believe I read that the BFRO went to Florida in 08 on an investigation and I believe it was off Rt.41? I think there is a few key locations that BFRO should check out, 1. Picayune Strand, just outside of Naples, Fl, http://www.fl-dof.com/state_forests/picayune_strand.html, 2. Turner River and Birdon Rds. just south of Ochopee, Fl off Rt. 41 http://www.staynplay.net/florida-tourism-articles/turner-river-road.htm I live in New Jersey but have a condo in Naples,Fl, if BFRO wants to investigate these areas I believe I can find time to come down and show you the exact spots of the occurences.

It was around 9:30 p.m., when we started hearing what sounded like wolf howls. The howling become a bit terrifying when we noticed it was getting closer. We then began howling back at it, when we realized we were caught right in between these things communicating. By this time it was already 11:00 p.m., around this time small pebbles began being hurled at us from a distance. It reached such a freaky level when whatever was in the woods just 30 ft. from us was stomping and grunting at us. For some reason at some point we thought for sure it was a prank and began throwing pieces of wood and rocks, when all of a sudden a horrible silence came over us. With none of us wanting to admit we were freaking out, we suddenly mad dashed for the trailer and hid in my dad's room (end of the trailer, pointing to the woods). Trying to play it off we tried sleeping huddled together like a can of sardines. We were overcome by tears and in a frozen like state. Knocking and grunting was all we heard for about an hour, until we gave our position in the trailer when my friend whispered to me to look out the window. For the final time a deep silence overcame outside. I slightly lifted one of the curtain blinds (not sure what their called, but there a series or levers that lift and tilt depending on how you pull or twist the small stick). When I looked out, not fearing due to the fact there were no lights on in the trailer, I saw nothing but what seemed to be my reflection in the glass, I thought I had confirmed it when I tilted my head and my supposed reflection did the same. When I released the blind and was asked what I saw, I told them it was my reflection. I waited about 4 minutes, in which seemed like a millenium, I opened the blinds, I saw nothing but branches and brush. I remember slowly dropping the blind and crying myself to sleep in a way my friends wouldn't hear me. I can't explain why, but whatever was looking back at me through that window could've easily killed me considering the trailer was on an incline and bricks due to the jacks breaking.

We were camping in a primitive campsite at Bear Island, Big Cypress Preserve in Collier County Florida. This campsite is off of ORV trails, meaning only off-road vehicles with permits may enter this area. It was a warm evening after a late afternoon rain shower. We had a camp fire burning, there were five of us at camp that night along with two Jeeps parked away from campsite. After sitting near the campsite I wanted to retrieve my charging cell phone from my Jeep. As i walked away from the camp and into the darkness of the night, I reached my Jeep, as I was opening the door, I had a feeling someone was watching me. I looked to my left and about 15' into the woods I saw a pair of glowing yellow, human shaped eyes staring back at me. I am 6'6\\\" tall, and these eyes were level with me, possibly a few inches upward. I could feel the eyes staring into mine, and I watched them blink, slow and deliberate, just like a human. The overwhelming odor was undeniable it smelled like a combination of skunk and wet dog. Every hair on my body stood up right, I had instant goosebumps from my head to toe, and every instinct told me to flee. Without hesitation I quickly returned to the campfire.....Telling everyone what I had just witnessed, and assuring them I was not joking, I gathered a spotlight and a companion and walked over to check it out, without a sound we crept up, and heard nothing. Shining the light into the woods we did not see any signs of an animal, no deer, no bear, no low branches for an owl to be perched on, just a bare spot in the woods where the eyes were coming from. I have watched shows where people talk of Bigfoot sightings, and I always question them. I say I would have chased that thing through the woods with a camera and a flashlight. but now I understand, when you do see something like this, its a combination of shock, fear, and instinct. I would not write in with this sighting if I didn't feel in my gut, and in my mind what I saw, was not something that SHOULD have been in those woods.I was reassured of my feelings this past weekend when we returned to camp in the same spot. We camped in the same location this past weekend. April 28th-29th 2012. Pink jeep number 7, Bear Island Campground, Big Cypress Preserve. This encounter however was not visual, but audible. We had a campfire, there were five of us sitting there. It was approx 10:15, when I playfully made a loud and long howl (Call) into the woods. However we all were astounded when I almost Instantly got a response. The howl, was not a coyote, it was not an owl, or a bear. And it was not a human playing along. The direction the sound came from, was also the direction I had seen the eyes in the woods previously. It is dense woods with no campsites, or foot access. Forward an hour in the future. Me and my daughter and wife are in our tent. My two friends are already asleep in theirs, staked out next to mine. The back of both of our tents are facing the opposite woods that we had heard the howl from. After being in our tents and laying down with the lights out. We were startled, by the loudest crashing sound coming from the woods behind us. It sounded like something just grabbed a tree, snapped it, and smacked part of it against itself. The sound was followed by a few footsteps, then silence. It was so loud and an unexpected sound it awoke the two friends in the tent next to us with a \\\"what the heck was that? \\\". My daughter was the first to notice the odor that was suddenly lingering. Her and my wife compared it to skunk, i thought it smelled more like wet dog, urine smell. Very similar to the odor I noticed previously with the eye incident. I did scout the area where we heard the noise, but could not see anything. No fallen trees, and no obvious damage from where I could access. It did start to rain in the area early in the am. So when we woke up, it had been raining for sometime.Making it harder to notice anything out of place. Am I 100% positive I saw Skunk Ape? No, but I am 100% positive there is something down here, and it could be just that.

At that time we lived north of Miami and would drive out SR 820 to US 27 to US 1 to get there.  After I got my own car and driver's license in the late 1960s I began making the trip down there ahead of the rest of the family usually leaving about 4am each Saturday. On one particular Saturday in '71 or '72 I had  made it down US 27 to about 200th Avenue(outside of Homestead in the Redlands)when I spotted red flashing lights ahead.  Obviously it was a wreck and it looked like it just happened - only there was just one damaged car just off the road.  The LE present were from the FHP and the Dade County SO.  I stopped my car on the side of the road, people did that back then, and got out. I noticed what I remember as an American mid-sized car with a very crumpled left front quarter panel. Just about that time a trooper and deputy sheriff emerged from a very densely wooded area at a right angle to the road.  That part of Dade County was very rural at the time and US 27 was generally the dividing line between anything that passed for civilization and the Glades.  I then also noticed that a man who was quite upset talking to them. One of the LEs was shaking his head and saying no one could have walked away from impacting a car at that speed and walked away let alone run away.  The other said he never saw a bear move like that.  Then a P/U truck stopped and another car.  The trooper told us there wasn't any need for us to be there and it was dangerous to be on the side of that road (traffic-wise it was one of the most dangerous in Fl). I never saw the creature or talked to the witnesses but I had this wierd feeling that you get when someone is staring at you - even before I knew what was going on.  I left and went on my way.  Well this wouldn't mean much to anyone except later that day I heard on a radio news broadcast that a man said he hit the Florida Skunk Ape and that he claimed that two LE Officers had given it chase into a dense thicket. I hadn't thought of much of this until about 15 years later I moved to another part of the state and got acquainted with hunters that claimed to have seen the creature, heard it, found its scat, and tracked it.

This was the most terrifying experience I have ever had in my entire life.  I don't mention this event to my friends because I am sure they would not believe me. When I was a young boy, I accompanied my Grand Father to his 98 acre farm every day from his home located in LaGrange.  He had about 60 head of cattle, hogs, chickens and a mule. He also grew corn and vegetables and had a 2 acre watermelon patch.  After doing my chores on the farm, I liked to roam all over the property, especially down to the creek and 10+ acre swamp which was created by beavers damning up the creek. It was late one winter afternoon and I was walking in the woods far away from the old farm house when I noticed some move in the woods behind me. I remember it was late in the day, almost the time of sunset, when I was walking along the path leading back to the house when I saw \\\"it\\\" out of the corner of my eye. A huge, 7 foot tall, ape-looking creature that was covered in tangled hair. The creature was standing completely still with its long arms hanging at its sides. The one thing that I saw that I will never forget was its 2 big yellow eyes that were staring straight at me. I felt my heart skip and knew this creature, or whatever it was, was like nothing I had ever seen in my life. It was about 80 yards away and I knew that if it started running, it could probably easily run me down as it had extremely long, gangly legs. I was completely and utterly terrified.  I knew the only way I could escape was to turn and run as hard and as fast as I could, back to the house. I did just that - jumping over the one cross-fence located between me and the house, which was about a quarter of a mile away. I knew that I tripped or snagged myself on the fence, the creature would catch me and rip me to pieces. I was near  exhaustion upon arriving back at the house; completely out of breath. I immediately went to my Grand Father's side where I almost collapsed. I never told him about my sighting or anyone else, until years later after I was married.  I have since then told my wife and parents and one close friend about my sighting. I will be more than happy to explain more about my Bigfoot sighting. I truly believe with all my heart that what I saw that day was a real Bigfoot. After my sighting, I never one time went down to the swamp by myself. Previous to my sighting, I would often find some of my Grand Father's young calves lying dead in the woods, near the swamp. I wondered how and why this could occur, but after my sighting, I knew that the Bigfoot had killed these young calves as well as some of a neighbor farmer's goats. I remember one calf that appeared to have been ripped open i.e. mutilated. Later, after my Grand Father passed away, my Mother inherited the property and allowed some of her friends to hunt deer on the old farm place. One hunter told us recently that he had heard a howling like none other while hunting very early one morning on the farm. He said it sounded, not like a cry or howl, but more like a scream. Said it even frightened him and he is a seasoned hunter of many years!

One of my brothers had shot a deer and they were following the blood trail in an attempt to locate the deer that had been shot.  I had been left at the bottom of the gully to watch equipment. The sun had already set, but it wasn't dark yet, twilight. I had waited for approximatly 20 to 30 mins, when \\\"something\\\" woofed at me from the edge of the tree line about 10 yards away. It was a deep sound that startled me.  After hearing this, I thought it better that I wait at the top of the gully, where my brothers had entered the woods. Before long, my brothers had returned, but without the deer.They had been unable to locate it. I told them what I had heard and neither of them took me too series. The 3 of us walked back to where the equipment had been layed, I didn't pick it up on my quick hike up the hill. After we had gathered the equipment, we started to walk up the opposite side of the gully going back to our vehicle. The trail was in a backwards \\\"L\\\" shape with the gully being on the long side of the L. As we began to walk up the hill, there were sounds of heavy foot falls in the woods on the side of the trail.  When we would stop walking the sounds would continue for a few seconds and then stop.  What ever was walking in the woods was walking parralell to us. My oldest brother called into the woods thinking it may be a lost hunter, but there was no response.We walked about another 20 yards and the foot falls continued.This became a big concern due to the fact that what ever was walking in the woods would eventually meet us going to our vehicle due to the shape of the trail, cutting us off from our vehicle.  Again, my oldest brother called into the woods, but with no response.  He then fired about 10 rounds into the air, thinking if it was an animal the sound would spook it away.  But again, as we started walking so did the \\\"animal\\\" in the woods.  My oldest brother again called into the woods, issueing a warning that what ever was there better leave or he would fire into the woods. No response, we started walking again and so did the \\\"animal\\\" in the woods. My oldest brother then proceeded to fire into the woods in the general direction of the sounds. We didn't notice if the foot falls continued, by this time we were all pretty scared and were working just to get back to our vehicle and go home.We made it back to the truck with no further incidents.We had all been raised in the woods and new the sound of most animals that normally would be encountered, but this was something very different.  Also, we had been  hunting this particular location for 2 seasons and had never experienced anything like this.  From that point on, I only hunted from a \\\"stand\\\" or with another person.\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"Twilight\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class B\"},\n",

It is not very densely populated, and most inhabitants of the mountain are members of the family. We were walking into the woods but were still within eyesight of two houses and a field. The boy and I noticed it about the same time. We saw a tall (about 7 feet tall), bulky, lumbering figure coming toward us, from about 30-40 feet away. It was lumbering upright but was hunched over. It had a very large head. It was coming toward us. We turned around and ran toward the clearing, yelling for the girl to follow us. It chased us and got to within probably 15 feet of us. It stopped before the edge of the woods. We didn't see where it went, because we ran until we were out of breath, well away from the edge of the woods The boy and I were trying to come to terms with what we had seen. We both agreed it looked like a cross between a man and a bear, or a man in a bear suit. For some reason I associate the color blue with it, as well. The girl said she never saw it, but she actually ran out in front of us. The boy and I didn't get a good look at facial features, as our main goal was to get the heck out of there. I do recall its face was hairy, not smooth. I do not recall any type of a noise, though I vaguely remember a strong, musty animal smell. I do not recall if we told any of their family what happened. I am thinking that we thought no one would believe us, and he and I were so very certain about what we had seen and experienced that we did not wish to have to defend ourselves. The fact that WE knew what had happened was enough. I did tell my parents, who thought it was a little incredible but never said that they didn't believe me.

I went to feed my two pit bulls around 11:30 pm one night, me and my wife had returned home late from eating out.  While taking the dogs food to them I heard a long moan / howl coming from the woods behind my house I at first thought it was my neighbor but it just did not make sense because it actually sounded farther off in the woods than my neighbors house sits. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I started surfing the internet later on after that and came across the BFRO website and played a few vocalizations and the Ohio Moan / Howl sounded just like the one I heard.  I actually talked to a couple of investigators on the matter. Since then I have become very interested in  Bigfoot and Sasquatch sightings and news. I decided to ask my wife if she had heard or seen anything unusual around the woods and house, she asked me why and I reluctantly  told her I thought I had heard a Sasquatch in the woods. She started laughing and said \\u201c I guess they throw rocks at the house and garage too\\u201d. Well my jaw dropped I asked her what she meant and she told me that the whole time I was  deployed to Iraq (2005-2006)when she would come out on the back porch to smoke at night some one would throw rocks and sticks at our garage which  is not attached to our house and sits back in the wood line some. She even had her brother come out and listen one night while he was down on vacation it freaked both of them out. That was pretty much the extent of every thing until 3 nights ago, the weather had turned really cold here in Ga and when I would go out to smoke at night I would not stay long. It was during one of the brief smoke breaks that around 1:00 AM I was staring out into the front yard when I caught some movement in the corner of my eye, I turned my head just in time to see the massive back, shoulders and head of this enormous creature disappear behind some bushes. It was fairly close to the yard light I have in my yard but just far enough away to not be able to tell the actual color of this thing I would guess a dark brown or grayish. I went out and measured a limb that I am fairly sure was about even with its head and the limb measured at exactly 10 feet so the height was about 10 feet tall it was slightly hunched over with no visible neck and a shoulder width, the best I can guess, of about 3-4 feet across it looked like it covered the distance of 6-7 feet with one step ( although I could not see its legs and feet I am judging by its gate) I could not see its face but its fur looked like a horses winter coat that had not been combed out.  \", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Griffin Ga\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"Hwy I-75\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Very thick scrub brush at the edge of my yard.\", \"COUNTY\": \"Spalding County\", \"DATE\": \"20 Jan 2009\", \"SEASON\": \"Winter\", \"YEAR\": \"2009\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"Exact location omitted.\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"Early Morning 1:00am Its was dark and very cold around 15 degrees out, the sky was clear.\"},\n",

Back in May 1998, I  had taken my first trip to the North Georgia Mountains, specifically the Tallullah Gorge area. After hiking to the bottom of the gorge I hiked  to another local area near a lake called Lake Rabun and I viewed some water falls called Minnehaha Falls. The sun was already setting and when I completed the fairly easy stroll to the falls I noted that I was the only person at the falls. I did not observe anything weird at that time, but I did catch a whiff of something smelly in the area. Not quite the smell of a dead animal, but the smell of something very musty and almost sweaty. I stayed until it was completely dark and I fished my flash light out of my backpack. As I finished my ham sandwhich, I began to get up off the ground to hike out. It was at this time I noticed a figure of what I thought was a person squatting to the right of the falls in some bushes. I thought it was another hiker I had either failed to see sitting there or someone who had arrived after me. I did not turn my light on yet and I did not want to turn it on so as to blind the other person. I began to walk in the direction of the other person to say hello and that is when it stood up and I could obviously tell the thing was about 9 to 10 feet tall. I still thought it was a very tall person until I got to within 20 feet of it and the smell became extremely bad. I could hear the thing breathing shallow and it kind of sounded like when a person has a chest cold with some gurgling or rattleing in the chest. I stopped and turned my light on and tried to shine it on the thing, but it began to turn away from me as it took very long strides as it walked on two legs. It was dark brown in color and had matted hair covering it's body. It stopped and turned towards me from about 60 feet away and took about 5-6 steps towards me in the bushes. I became scared and drew my service pistol from my fanny sack (I am a police officer) and stood my ground while yelling at it to stop. It stopped and then turned away. The creature walked away without turning back. I left the area and drove back to my apartment in Marietta Georgia.

This incident occurred with he and my brother-in-law (b-i-l)in 1984 or 1985 (he is not sure of the year since so much time has passed). He and my b-i-l were deer hunting in the fall on some old growth hardwood/pine forrest near where my f-i-l was raised. They had drove into the area, parked, then separated to go to their respective hunting areas (he up hill about 100 yards from the vehicle and my b-i-l about 100 yards down away fromt the vehicle in a bottom area). As they met back at their vehicle, my b-i-l related that he had come across a deer carcass that was torn apart (limbs appeared \\\"ripped\\\" from the trunk and the trunk torn open). He had never seen anything like it. They hiked back to the area and to the carcass and had to push physically push through some thick growth to the site of the carcass. My f-i-l related that the kill was fresh, no more than 24 hours old at the oldest as there was no decay, had not been scattered by scanvengers, and it was too fresh to have maggots hatching. While looking, he related that he began to have a strong feeling of being watched and began to smell something that was a combination of a wet dog and rotting garbage. As it was getting dark, they headed back to their truck. He said the truck was about 100 yards away and as they walked, he noticed the sound of something walking parallet to themabout 10-15 yards into the undergrowth. As they reached the truck (they had both unloaed their guns earlier), something in the underbush less than 10 yard away he estimated, \\\"screamed\\\" at them. He related that he had heard peacocks, deer, bobcat, etc while growing up and while hunting. and this was like nothing either of them had ever heard. Both of them are avid deer and turkey hunters with primitive weapons and firearms and have spent a great deal of time in the woods. The sound was so strange and unnerving that he said the hair on his arms and neck stood up. They both fumbled with their guns trying to reload and to get in the truck as it was almost full dark by then. They immediately left the area as fast as possible. My b-i-l passed away in 1999 and to my knowledge, I never remember or know of him telling anyone else about this. My f-i-l took me back out to the area on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2007. This was the first time he had been back since the incident occurred. He related that he could close his eyes and still hear that scream and he could feel his hairs standing up. We walked the area but it has been clear cut for timber and is now leased to a hunting club (Inland Paper is the land owner) and a gate has been put up so that you have to walk to the area where the incident occurred. The area is in the nw part of the county very close to the Alabama state line. There is no one living close to this area still, there is running water, a large deer population going by the tracks we saw and scat, as well as good cover provided by timber piles and second growth forest returning.

Well we decided to transport our horses behind our house so we cut down about 4 acres of trees, leveled it off and built a barn and fenced the area in. About 5 months later after everything was built and finished I would get bored and I would go in the pasture and hang out with the horses, feeding them just hanging out. I have 3 horses: Rambo, a Tennessee Walker, all black and 17 hands high. Reno, a Blanket Apaloosa, grey/white, 12 hands high. And Dakota, a Morgan red tone, 13 hands high. I was in the pasture standing by my horses Rambo and Reno. The pasture had a barn in the far back, in the right corner.  As I'm standing by Reno and Rambo I heard some movement in the brush to my right. To the left of the barn about 40 yards from me as I turned and looked, my horses Reno and Rambo spooked and ran toward my house away from the barn. As I look at this thing, I could only see the left front side of it facing me, hidden in the brush. The color was a red auburn. I thought, what is Dakota doing? Then I realize this thing is outside of the fence. I thought Dakota got out so as I walk toward what I thought was my horse, Dakota. At that time, Dakota runs out of the barn beside me and runs to the house. At that point I froze and the hair stood up on my neck. This up-right walking figure stepped to its left, made a grunt sound/breathing, looked right at me then turned pushing small trees and brush over and taking off into the woods. It was about 8 1/2 feet tall, massive in size and covered in red hair. The thing I call Bigfoot was ripped, very strong. As it took off you could hear the foot steps, very heavy.

At the time I assumed it was a panther (but have recently heard there is no extant recording a such a thing.  That and I drive past Woman Hollering Creek outside of San Antonio from time to time and am reminded).  There was nothing else.

      "{\"REPORT_NUMBER\": \"14887\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class B\", \"OTHER_WITNESSES\": \"Yes, my girlfriend (may as well say wife, we have been together 18 years and lived here ten of those).She was in bed with me when I heard the dogs barking. She was asleep when I got up to quiet them down thinking that it was another dog or a deer back in the woods.\", \"ALSO_NOTICED\": \"I have lived on this land for a decade. I have always kept dogs in a fenced in yard that borders the wooded area of the property. At just after 1:30 am I awoke to my dogs barking in a very agressive manner.  I got out of bed to go and shut them up, thinking that it was likely just a dog or deer that was wandering through the woods at night. It was nearly a full moon this night. I should add here that in the ten years I have lived here I have never seen a human in the woods behind my home. I stepped out onto the back porch in my underwear and yelled at the dogs. This is where it got very different from all the countless times I had quieted them in the past. I yelled,\\\"Alright, ya'll chill out. People are sleeping....\\\" and before I finished the sentence I heard footsteps, NOT of a four legged variety, but one very methodically after the other.This got my full attention. I have a storage building at the back corner of my yard. My first thought was that somebody must be trying to break into it. It sits in the very back corner of the fence and could be accessed by hopping over a four foot chain link fence. I went back inside to grab a flashlight and my 9mm pistol, but as I went back in the door I heard a sort of scream/shreik. It was very loud and actually made me jump a bit. I was thinking it was likely teenagers at this point, likely shouting some sort of insult, but there was something unnerving about the way it carried into my home. I told my girlfriend, who was stirring back to being awake, that there was somebody walking in the woods making weird noises and that she needed to come hear it for herself and I am going to run them off. I ran back onto the porch and shouted,\\\"Whoever you are, I am going to let these dogs out so you'd better speak and be on your way!\\\" No response came back, but the footfalls were obviously close to the fenceline and were heavy sounding. I went over to the gate and the dogs would not leave the yard or my side. This is the first time ever that I have witnessed them refuse a chance to run in the woods. At this point I was a bit angry and embarrassed that I had made a threat to the intruder and the dogs just stayed put. This was when my whole world was tilted on it's ear. I shouted that \\\"I am about to come out there and find you and when I do I am going to shoot you\\\", figuring that this would make whoever it was haul thier ass out of there. As I yelled this thing went from one end of my yard, around the corner of the fence to up near the front of my yard in less than 15 seconds with a very distinct two legged sound, loud and heavy. In broad daylight I could not duplicate this speed in twice the time. There are obstacles everywhere that you will bust your butt out there. I had no intention of going into the woods in my underwear and barefooted so I chambered a round and fired three shots into the ground with the fourth being a misfire that I quickly cleared. At that moment something started shrieking and howling at extremely high decible levels and was coming closer...not running away, but running towards the side of the front of the house where I was standing. My girlfriend was up on the side porch and was asking,\\\"What the hell is that?\\\" and then, even though I was between her and the woods, she said she was going back in the house. Normally when an animal is in the woods I can trick it into looking into the flashlight by making a high pitched noise or whistle, thereby giving me a look at its position.This time, this thing never revealed its eyes to me. I found that to be very unusual. I have to add here that I was physically shaking at how much noise this thing made and how heavy it sounded as it kept howling/wailing/screaming and moving around in the treeline just beside my fence. I am 6'4\\\", 290 pounds and I am not fat. My friends often joke that I am a shaved sasquatch. I am 41 years old and have worked as a bouncer/babysitter in bars from the nicest type, all the way down to the nudie bar hell-holes. I am NOT an easy man to intimidate! Whatever was moving out there was MUCH bigger than me, as well as much faster. I moved up onto the side porch to be ready to flee from whatever the hell it was. I would be lying if I said otherwise here. I was badly shaken by this thing. Being unable to see it while it was so close was chilling my blood. When I got to the porch and up the stairs (both porches are about five feet above ground) it moved back away into the woods, likely a couple of hundred feet. How do I know this? I heard it as it went, one step after another, then I and my girlfriend who was standing just inside the side porch door, hear what seemed to be heavy timber being smacked or knocked together. It came in a sucession of three \\\"whumps\\\" each time, which really unnerved me, as I had just fired three rounds. Coincidence or not, it was like it was letting me know it was aware of what I just did and replicated this three knocks/slams each time and would pause for a few seconds between doing so again. It stopped doing this and I shouted out again, this time saying something to the effect of \\\"Who are you?\\\", and then I heard it moving back this way yet again. It moved so fast that it really defies anything logically explained away and again, the very heavy and rhythmic sound of one foot after another was very audible. I was only shouting at this point because in the back of my mind I WANTED to hear a human voice or laughter from kids.....anything but that god awful howl again. I was hoping for a known explanation or reason for the sounds to be as loud as they were, like maybe a recording played through a bullhorn or something, but I knew that this was something very different. My mind was refusing to believe that this was real, yet there I was hearing it for myself. At this point my girlfriend was pleading for me to come back inside so she could lock the doors. I went inside and put on some pants and shoes, dug the video camera out and turned off all the lights on the backside of the house. I wish I had taken it out the first time, but I believed that it was a prowler or vandal at first so there was not reason to take a camera...a gun and flashlight are my two best bets in that case. I truly regret not having it with me when this thing started making those sounds. I crept down the stairs to the yard in the darkness. I sat there for a while and then decided to move over toward the fenceline by the side porch. Just then , from the woods there came those damned footfalls again. I was in the dark (I had a flashlight too, but I did not want to reveal my position) and this thing was shadowing my movements from the left to the right of the yard, staying an equal distance it seemed outside the fence. This I did for over an hour with it moving every single time I did. I would remain stationary for five to ten minutes each time. At one point I thought I heard my dogs down in my storage shed. I figured they went in there to bed down. I walked back up my stairs to go inside and my blood ran cold when I realized that both dogs were cowering in my living room. I had not pulled the door closed behind me when I went outside, and they had to be physically removed from the house to the back porch.That has also never happened before. At this point I actually went into my workroom and grabbed a thick peice of wood and cut it to bar the back door from sliding open. In the decade I have lived here I have NEVER had a lock on my back door due to the fact that there were always dogs in the yard who hate everything that is not me or my family. Nobody goes in the back yard. I thought about calling the sherriffs department, but what could I tell them? I am afraid a bigfoot is pissed at me and is after me? I don't think so. It just sounds too damned crazy! That all happened the first night. The next day I was mad that I was so afraid the night before. I had two rechargeable spotlights, but neither one was working that night, bulbs or batteries were bad...who knows. I went to Home Depot and bought a 2.25 million candlepower spotlight and went home that afternoon. I have hunted all my life, so I thought I would rig up some light along my fenceline near the shed and if it came back I would flip a switch and turn night into day and maybe get a look at this thing as it fled the light into the same dark corner of my lot, at which point I would light it up with the 2.25 million candlepower light. My girlfriend walked to the shed with me and I went to the fence to position the light.  As I got to the fence I was talking to her, saying,\\\"If I put it here it should run it back to the other side...\\\" and there it was. I saw with my own eyes. Between two trees and some brush, there was a 3x3 foot section of long brown fur,  clearly visible and moving slightly. I yelled, \\\"There it is!\\\" and although my girlfriend thought I was kidding, she saw the bushes as they were being parted as something moved rapidly into the more dense growth. It was not a bear. It was not a dog. It was too massive. I think I saw the rounded back of this animal as it sort of \\\"duck-walked\\\" away towards a creekbed. It was gone in a matter of seconds and I was not going to chase it. We were standing there in total disbelief. The damned thing was STILL there the next day in broad daylight. It just seemed too surreal to believe. Was it waiting for me? We waited for a while and never heard anything move. It was in there and it was trying to hide.We walked around to the front part of the shed and that is when we noticed two odd things.One was that there is black water bubbling up from the ground and it has a very strong smell to it. This is on the other side of the yard from where my septic lines should be as well as uphill from it. I am wondering if this smell drew this thing in close to my home. Secondly was the spookiest of all. There is a footprint in my yard that measures 15 inches in lentgh right by my fence where it seems like it stepped over into the woods. It is in the soggy part near the blackwater. I tried to replicate it myself with my size 14's but the difference is huge. It seems to have a rounded heel and toes seem to be visible. I do not know if plaster will set there due to this new mystery spring that has crept up, but I covered it with a paint rollor trey to protect it from the dogs walking on it.I do not see how it could be from anyone but me in this yard, and once again, I cannot duplicate it. I hope there is an explanation for this print other than a friggin sasquatch in my yard. There is also a branch broken in my yard at the ten to twelve foot height on a fresh limb that we just noticed. The thought of it coming over the fence into my \\\"safe zone\\\" is a little more than I want to believe right now. I went exploring the woods today with a friend who told my that he has read that sometimes sticks or big limbs will be stacked in a triangle or pyramid fashion. We found at least seven such things back in that area along and around the creekbed, some of which were from a species of tree that is nowhere near the site. These do not seem to be anything that naturally would happen if a branch falls. I do not know if these are significant or not. I also found a five inch diameter tree that has been knocked down with all the roots intact and not enough vegitation on it to account for the wind having done it.This is just on the other side of my fence, right behind my shed.\", \"STATE\": \"Georgia\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"hiram/douglasville\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"austin bridge/bakers bridge rd\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"This occured in an area that is flanked to the north by a swamp/marsh waterway.To the north as well there are farmlands with cattle.

They are so large on the camera that closest thing it would resemble would be a bear, but I dont think bears are in the Helmand Province of Afghanistan. Things that make you wonder what is really out there and how well they have adapted to their environments.\", \"STATE\": \"Georgia\", \"OBSERVED\": \"It was roughly around the end of August 2011 and I was at my mothers house. The house is located in the Burnt Hickory area of Paulding County, GA. She lives in a subdivision but it is still out in the country. I have always been and still a night owl. I stepped out on her back deck around 0200 in the morning to have a cigarette. Behind her house is nothing but trees, shrubs, hills, and creeks. There is an abundance of wildlife in the area that range from deer to coyotes. I was a Reconnaissance Marine for 8 years with multiple deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan. I have been to numerous survival schools all over America from Maine to California. Most of my life was spent in the woods and I understand what animals make what sounds. I do not unnerve very easily. So back to my story. I was on the back deck smoking a cigarette when I heard this loud howl/scream. The first howl grabbed my attention instantly. Because I had only heard it one time I was unsure what it was. So I listened with a bit more interest the second time and I was trying to run everything through my mind to to figure out what it was. I knew it was not a deer or coyote because the howl was so deep. So then I started to think about my surroundings. There is a highway a couple miles away so I thought it may have been a big rig/semi. Then I heard it again. That option was completely ruled out. So I started to think of what else it could be. Perhaps it was a generator running in the woods. Again I heard the howl. Not a generator! I had run through so many different scenarios that I was starting to get freaked out. The howl was from a living creature and it was much larger than I. Each howl lasted approx. 5 seconds with a 10-15 second rest before the next. I stood out there for about 5 minutes before listening to this before I was to freaked and headed inside. I immediately ran up to my computer and googled howling sounds in Paulding County, GA. There were several websites regarding howling in the area but most of them were referring to Picketts Mill Battlefield. Then I came across BFRO. Initially I was like \\\"yeah...okay!\\\". I started looking through the website and I came across some of the audio submissions from Ohio. Once I heard it I nearly crapped my pants. That howl was to a T of what I heard. The only difference was mine sounded much deeper, closer, and I didn't have dogs barking in the background. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. I read through some of the other posts from Paulding County and Bartow County. What they all had to say was pretty freaky. Then I looked at the time frames they were made and where. During those time frames there was construction in the area. And when I heard my sounds they had just recently begun construction in the area. Not sure if there is any connection with that. I did bring it up to my wife the next day and she could hear the fear in my voice as I talked about it.

It did not have a bow legged affect. Which made it seem human but it looked like an ape. It started to move towards the road walking on two legs. My lights stayed on it. It seemed to want out of my lights. When it walked for the road it was headed in the path of my truck. I was on a small curve. So my lights followed it. I hit my fog lights & it turned back from the direction it came. It picked up speed and started to run still on two legs. I could see the foot falls & the thigh muscles bounce.

Been going there for years fishing and camping. Not extremely remote but wild and beautiful none the less.Its actually an old home place that has long disappeared, nothing remains except the concrete foundation and a narrow overgrown road that was once the driveway.Was very cold the night before, mid 20s,but the sun was shining bright and it was starting to warm up. I made the relatively short hike down the old road bed to my spot by the river.I dropped my pack against a tree and went down the step embankment to the rivers edge to check out the water and soak up some sunshine to warm up.After a few minutes I heard what I thought was another fisherman or someone up above me where the old foundation was.I thought \\\"great,so much for peace and quiet, must be hardcore trout fisherman like me to be here in cold weather\\\". I walked back up the embankment expecting to see people,, what I saw in broad day light, probably 30-40yds directly in front of me was what I can only describe as what appeared to be a fully erect gorilla, except his face didn't protrude out,it was flatter,and the hair was the color of a squirrel, browns, black, silver & a slight tint of red when the sun reflected off him.He was standing there, head slightly tilted back, squinting his eyes,soaking up the sunshine, just as I was.I couldn't comprehend what I was looking at at first. My first thought was \\\"what am I looking at?\\\".. Second thought was\\\" God,look how big he is\\\". It was incredibly muscular, at least 4ft wide at shoulders, 7-8ft in height,massive animal. The skin was a dark grayish color around the face, head was extremely pointed, like a dunce hat almost, no neck,large pectorals visible under the hair. Eye color was like a shade of amber. It was squinting in the bright sun, soaking up some warmth. He didn't really see me at first I don't think.I did kinda pop up over the embankment, I think he knew I was there but didn't really know where .He could have been trying to smell me. I watched this massive beautiful animal standing there in the bright sun for probably 15-20 seconds.I had a feeling of amazement, wonder & actually privileged .I knew that what I was looking at was truly one of Gods immaculate creations. It was beautiful, big and scary as hell, but beautiful. Hair was clean, looked groomed almost. Very healthy animal. After 15-20 seconds of seeing this I actually stepped up over the embankment all the way in view and I said out loud something like \\\"hey big boy,ain't you a pretty thing!\\\" That's when it finally saw me. It dropped its head down & froze. I could tell I surprised it. It wouldn't make eye contact. I could see its whole posture change. It became very shy& acted like it was hoping that as long as it didn't look directly at me I wouldn't see him. It was like a bashful child.I took a few steps toward it and said \\\"hey big boy\\\" ,or something to that effect, and that was enough for him. He turned to his left and he was out of there. I could here the limbs & leaves rustling as he made his getaway. He moved like a deer going up the mountain, fast fast. Didn't see him but I could hear him. After probably 5 seconds the rustling stopped and it was totally silent. Then I clearly hear what sounded like someone doing a drum roll with wooden sticks on a wooden table. Three\\\" brat-tat-tat-tat's,very quick, very clear, definitely not a woodpecker. No doubt in my mind it was him. He had traversed the mountain side and was on the ridgeline above me in no more than 5-10 seconds. Unbelievable. I never felt threatened, never felt afraid. Was a feeling of privilege & respect. I set up camp and stayed at that spot for the night and all the next day but never saw it again.

Gordon that also ran into a Bigfoot.  This convinced me to write what happened to me many years before this soldiers incident.  It may have been the same Bigfoot.\", \"OTHER_STORIES\": \"Yes, just the one about the soldier I have just mentioned above.\", \"STATE\": \"Georgia\", \"OBSERVED\": \"The year was 1965 while my father a military NCO Basic Training Instructor, was stationed at Ft. Gordon Georgia.  We were living on the base at the NCO old housing area.  There had recently been built a new housing area but we lived in the old Army barracks converted to housing where four families were accommodated to live in a barracks of four apartments.  There were more barracks converted to housing in the same area and woods to the left of the housing that led to some old infantry fields no longer in use of dense pine trees.  Near these woods, there were two barracks of Military Police units. One day, the girl from the apartment below informed me that her little brother would tell her that a big man would look through their window at night.  The little boy would observe the man looking into the room.  To the both of us, this seemed amazing since the window bottom ledge of the barracks where we lived was about 7 or 8 ft. from the ground.  It would be impossible for any normal size human being to look into the window from that height.  I paid no attention to it and soon forgot the story. During the summer vacations, I would enjoy venturing into the woods next to the housing area with my friends.  We would go downwind and get as close to deer as possible just to take a photo or observe the animals without disturbing them.  I remember one morning my friends were not around so I decided to go and venture the woods by myself.  As I walked down the slope into the woods and began walking on level ground just about 200 hundred yards at the edge of the woods, I noticed that a bulldozer had just scraped the land next to the Officers Housing area.  The Army was going to make a new housing for the Officers in that part of the woods.  I also noticed on the red clay of the ground some big footsteps that came from the Officers Housing into the edge of the woods where I was walking into. The last footsteps that lead into the woods from the red clay were so enormous that I began to observe them.  I noticed they were of a person walking barefoot, at least 18 inches in length and about 5 inches wide.  The person or whatever it was that had made the prints had a total of 5 toes.  I had never heard of Bigfoot and just thought it was some big person walking around barefoot enjoying the mud (red Clay). I then went into one of the many trails that led into the woods and after a few minutes, something seemed not to be right.  I did not hear birds nor did I see any squirrels.  Everything seemed to be silenced.  I could only hear the wind blowing and the trees moving in the wind but no sign of life in the area.  This began to give me what you call the goose bumps as if someone or something was watching all my moves.  I then sat on a big rock nearby and observed everthing around me and at the same time kept my ears opened.  Just a few moments went by when I started to hear some heavy bi-pedal footsteps in the grass and leaves near me at about 50 ft. of distance from where I sat.  The grass was very high and there was lots of brush that did not allow me to see more than 20 ft. into the brush area.  I guess you can say that my human nature or animal instinct just took over me, telling me to get out from there as fast as possible.  I did not waste any time, but controlled my self not to go into panic. I steadily began to walk out of the woods and as I did, I could hear the heavy bi-pedal footsteps stalking me from the left, deeper in the woods from where I was at.  If I stopped walking, it would stop walking.  If I ran a little, it would run a little.  I also became aware that whatever it was, would stop walking just a few seconds after I did.  In other words, it would stop and begin to walk as I did.  As I got closer to the edge of the woods at the red clay area, whatever was in the woods began to run very fast coming towards me.  I then thought it was time to run like hell.  I picked up a running speed that surprised me.  When I finally got back to the housing area, I was exhausted trying to get my breath back again and sat on the porch in front of my home.  A friend that lived across the street had observed me and asked what had scared me.  He said he saw me running out of the woods as if my butt was on fire.  This got me a little upset and when I finally got all my breath back, I explained the ordeal to him.  He just stood there and laughed at me.  Since he did not believe me, I made him a challenge to go into the woods with me where I had heard the footsteps.  He accepted the challenge and we both returned to the area.  While walking down the path near the Officers Housing area, I showed him the footprints in the red clay.  He observed them leading into the woods and said to me that the prints must be those of the Bigfoot monster.  I had never heard of it and told him monsters don't exist, it must be some big hillbilly or hobo person living in the area that does not want us to disturb him.  We both went into the same trail I had went into before and sat on the same rock.  Shortly after, the same weird sensation got over us.  There was a total silence and only the wind and trees moving in the breeze could be heard.  Suddenly, the heavy bi-pedal footsteps once again began to stalk us in the brush as it did when I was by myself.  I told my friend to walk a little ways and then to stop.  As we stopped walking, whatever was stalking us would also stop.  When I looked at my friend, he seemed to have changed in skin color to almost a tomato red.  I knew he was more afraid than I was at the moment.  I then told my friend to stop once again and listen to our stalker getting closer.  As we stopped, heavy footsteps began to run towards us.  We could hear the brush breaking and moving.  When I turned around to tell my friend that it was time to start running, he had already begun his run and had about a 40 ft. lead on me.  I did not waste time to look back and ran as close as I could to my friend.  When we got back to the housing and sat on my porch trying to get our breaths back, he said he had seen something big that moved in the brush.  He was not certain what it was. To date, I know it was the Bigfoot creature because of the footprints I had observed earlier in the red clay.  I did not smell anything peculiar because we were down wind from it.  We did not hear anything except maybe a heavy breathing if I could remember correctly and the brush and grass moving about as it came towards us.

Preliminary  investigation by the BFRO: I talked to the reporter and called the BP Quick Stop and spoke with one of the women who was there the night the guy came in to use their phone. I have yet to get in touch with the witness, J.N. that saw the creature. Here are a few extra notes: Tim Chitwood (reporter) heard the story from a Sheriff's deputy in Russell County. The incident happened on August 30. The call to 911 was made at 10:54 pm. J.N. never called a Game Warden as the story stipulates. He called 911 from the Quick Stop in Fort Mitchell, AL. No report was filed with any police agency due to the fact that the witness was not willing to go back to the camping area with an officer. On the 911 tape the witness did state that \\\"it\\\" walked upright. The women at the Quick stop would not give their names, but stated they saw the dog, and it looked okay, they didn't see any blood. Apparently, the dog had walked off from the camp site and started making strange noises. The women did concur on the fact that the witness was \\\"scared as hell\\\" when he came in. The witness told them that it was taller than himself, and he saw the silhouette and the eyes as it kept moving towards him. The camp ground where this occurred is named after an old plantation owner who owned the land. It is also known for it's Indian Mounds. The mounds are not burial sites, but foundations for the dwellings the Indians lived in.

We came out of the water probably about a mile from the other unit. Shortly after exiting the water we could hear something or someone following us. We thought maybe it was our instructors, but then decided it couldn't be. No one in their right mind would have followed us through the water and no one knew the route we took. Although we didn't see it, it was easily within 25 yds. It would come up behind us. When you would expect to see it, it would cut off to the right or left, go around us, fade off, and then we would hear it coming again. This went on for 10 or 15 minutes. Wanting to see it we tried to trick it by having Sgt. W. and Pvt. P. sit tight and the rest of us would move out slowly, then in 5 minutes they would pick up and move out. The thing started weaving in and out of the two groups like in a figure-8. Then we couldn't hear it anymore. We met up a couple of hundred yards later with the other 2 soldiers and they said the same thing -- that it came between the 2 groups, around them, toward us, like it knew exactly where we were even though we couldn't see it. Later about 400 meters from our objective we set in a patrol base and decided we would conduct the last phase in 2 man teams with myself and Sgt. H. going first, Sgt. W., Pvt. P. and Pvt. S.  staying at the patrol base until our return in a couple of hours, at which time 2 others of the patrol would go out. This is when it got really wierd, we were about half way to the objective when we heard something following us again. We got to the opposite side of a somewhat open area and laid down facing the direction of the noises. Probably 5 minutes passed and all of a sudden this scream-roar is the only way I can explain it. We looked at each other and I said \\\"what the hell was that\\\".  We had never heard anything like that before. About a minute later it screamed again and then we heard what sounded like a huge rotten tree falling, and brush breaking. That was the last we heard and the last I wanted to hear.

I was in the Army stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia. My job at the time was as a gunner on a Bradley Fighting Vehicle. My unit was in the field conducting a training exercise which was to last a few days. The Bradley fighting vehicle is an armored tracked vehicle that normally has a crew of three; (Vehicle Commander, Gunner and Driver). One night around 2AM my vehicle was moving solo along a dirt road (we called them tank trails) in the northeast part of Fort Stewart. We were driving blacked out with no lights on. I was acting as gunner and had my head buried in the thermal sight system which is used to engage targets at night. The thermal sight distinguishes differences in heat signatures and formulates a picture in either white hot or black hot (depending on what you have selected) against a red background. The driver had the hatch closed and was using a night vision device to view the road. The vehicle commander was standing up out of the hatch looking through night vision monoculars. While moving along, if we encountered an intersection I would slew the turret either left or right (90 degrees) over the side of the vehicle to look down the road and clear it of any simulated enemy. At one particular intersection I did this maneuver,  slewed the turret over the right side of the vehicle and looked down the trail. It was clear and the vehicle made a right turn. After turning we drove approximately one hundred yards. The vegetation was extremely thick in this area due to being a swamp and about 10-12 feet high. As I was looking through the sight I observed something come out of the vegetation, approximately fifty yards in front of us, from the right side of the road and walk across the road to the left and re-enter the vegetation. The dirt road is approximately 15-20 feet wide. This creature cleared the road in three steps at a normal stride. It didn't seemed bothered by us or in a rush. I don't recall it looking in our direction. Its head and torso were straight and it just walked on. Typically while looking through the thermal sight at a person you can distinguish clothing, hair, equipment they may be wearing, etc and be able to judge their height with the surroundings they are standing in. This creature appeared through the thermal sight to be one constant color from head to foot, have no clothes on and to be fairly tall, approximately 7-9 feet. The first thought that came to my head was a bigfoot. At the time it all just seemed to make sense. From watching documentaries and reading books as a kid it all seemed to fit.  Everything happened very quickly. I was shocked when I saw it and said nothing till after it went back into the woods. I announced to the vehicle commander over the internal comm system that something just walked across the road and it wasn't a man or an animal. He got spooked and told the driver to punch it. I wanted to stop and investigate but no one else was having that. We were never able to go back and now I could only vaguely point out a general area we were in.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Ft.

At first we thought it was someone,then we realized it was not a human when it walked right under the light heading toward the left side of the house.

He had not been to the woods in about 8 years and he thought that the incidents were scary just because he was a kid. We decided to go camping in the woods for the first time in 2006. It was in the winter time and the leaves were crunchy on the ground.  We went to the camp site where my husband used to camp and set up everything.  The camp site was about two football fields away from the main trail down in the valley.  We were on a sand bar that extended out into the water and there was only one trail in and out for this site. Right as it began to get dark it got very still and quiet. There were no birds, no dogs barking and we could not hear anything moving around.  We started cooking dinner and right when it got dark we heard the most horrifying scream that I have ever heard in my life.  The sound was so loud that I could feel it in my chest like someone was holding an air horn right out in front of me. We were bound and determined to stay the night so we just brushed it off as an owl or something. After the sound we could hear walking, very heavy two legged walking.  We did not know what to think so we just shrugged it off as a deer.  We decided to go to bed and get some sleep and just make it through the night.  As we were lying in the tent the walking got louder and then we heard a loud kerplunk in the water next to the tent.  We pushed it off as a beaver.  Then it did it again and we could not take any more so we decided to just grab some of our things and leave. As we were getting out of the tent we could hear the walking in front of us.  The thing was walking down our path towards us.  My husband had a 22 gun and decided to call out a bunch of warnings to make sure that it was not a person.  We had two high beam flashlights on the path and we saw eyes. They were big with no visible pupils, and they were green. My husband felt that we were in danger and decided to shoot three times at the eyes.  When he shot the thing walked towards us three steps and stopped.  I do not know about you but a normal animal will run when gun shots are fired at the close of a range (about 30 feet).  We got back to the camp site and felt trapped and helpless because we do not know how to get out of the woods with this thing in our path.  My husband ended up calling one of his high school friends that he had not spoken to in about 5 years to come and help us. Our friend came to our rescue and brought a bigger weapon and more lights.  From what my husband says the thing followed us out of the woods the entire way.  This story is one of about 6 so far. After that night our friends wanted to go out there to investigate so we went out there the next day and looked around. We could not find any tracks or hair but there were some trees and vines that actually formed a dome shape that a 6\\u2019 person could stand straight up in.  There were little piles of sticks under there and a spot flattened out big enough for a grown man to lie down on. The next night it was walking around us and it also knocked sticks together and screamed at us again and we left around 10:00pm that night and left the camping gear behind.  We have been out there about 6 other times and it is always there waiting for us so that it can scare us out of the woods again. Just to give you a little bit of a back ground on our witnesses.

There was a drop off, due to the logging, so it was easy to stay out of sight. On this particular night, there were some does feeding/watering and tey jerked around looking behind them, up the hill, flagged and ran. We sat there waiting to see what spooked them and then we saw this creature walking upright across the hill, but downward, toward where the deer were.

He was approx. 8 feet tall and was about the color of a deer. He was walking upright with long strides, his arms hung down to his knees, and his head was extremely large. It looked to me like his head was bigger than it should have been. He had sharp pointy features and darker hair was on the top of his head and down the back of his neck, spreading across his shoulders to about the shoulder blades and fading out. The rest of his hair was lighter in color and was close to the skin, like a deer. He walked on the right side of the road and as we approched, he veered off the shoulder of the road and eased off in the ditch, where he reached up and grabbed a mimosa tree limb, pulled it down as if to hide his face from us. We both could see him from his shoulders down. I seen his ribs, the muscles in his hips and thighs, and legs, and partly his back. That's when I seen the hair fade into short close hair. I remember in detail, his face was distorted almost, and darker. The cheek bones were almost spikey, (for lack of a better word).

      "{\"REPORT_NUMBER\": \"18377\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class B\", \"STATE\": \"Georgia\", \"OBSERVED\": \"My family has an 800 acre farm in Haralson County, GA.  Our farm is on the border of Paulding County, GA., near the small \\\"town\\\" of Draketown (it's more of a settlement than a town).  We typically spend about one weekend out of the month at our farm where we have a nice cabin (house).  The land consists of pasture (no cattle), pines, hardwoods, swamp, and five pretty large lakes.  Whenever we are down there we go spotlighting at night to look at deer.  We don't hunt the deer on our land and usually see 50-80 deer a night just riding around and looking at them.  Being only about 1.5 hours from Atlanta this area is EXTREMELY remote and secluded.  It's all private land and not much activity occurs around there. During this past Christmas holiday there were 6 adults in our group in a Suburban riding down the dirt roads through our farm after a cookout at the cabin.  As we neared the main pasture near our barn where we feed corn to the deer we were puzzled to see a large herd of deer \\\"flying\\\" out of the pasture into the hardwoods.  This was shocking because they know that headlights mean new corn and they usually stand around waiting on the new feed.  As we rounded the bend that opens up into the pasture we saw a large, \\\"black\\\", two-legged creature cross the dirt road, see our lights, and then turn around and enter the heavy pines it had entered the road from.  We have no idea what we saw and don't have the time to really investigate, however, we know that it was at least as large as a large grown man, walked on two feet, had weired looking long arms, and didn't show it's face to us. It was uniformly black and couldn't have had clothes on to look like it did.  It seemed surprised to see our lights round the bend but did not seem worried or in a hurry to get out of sight (though it did in about 3 seconds).  We rode around the loop we were on and came back to the point where we had the sighting and nothing had changed.  No deer, nothing.  We discussed this for several days and decided it had to have been a bear, but we all know that it couldn't have been.

I was 12 or 13 at the time when I  had 3 different encounters within about 2 weeks\\u2019 time with something that I now believe to be Bigfoot. First incident happened one sunny afternoon when my neighbor and I had gone down to the creek behind his house to fish for what we called horny heads, little fish with horns on the top of their head.  We were one house over from his house and had been fishing in this deep hole for about 20 minutes when his dog Tiger started acting very strange.  Tiger was one of the meanest dogs I have ever known and not afraid of anything at all.  Well Tiger started running around in circles and whimpering, I looked at my neighbor and asked him \\u201cwhat was wrong with your dog\\u201d and he said \\u201che did not know he had never seen the dog do that.\\u201d  Well next thing we knew Tiger is tucking his tail between his legs and running all out for the house.  It was then that we heard from the hill behind us what I can only describe as what sounded like a lady being torn apart.  This was the most blood curling scream I have ever heard.  My neighbor and I dropped our polls and ran straight to the house.  Neither of us turned to see what was on the hill behind us.  When we got to the house we found Tiger under the house in the crawl space where he stayed for the next 3 days.  We could not get him to step foot out from there.  People said it might have been a bobcat or something like that but I feel certain Tiger would have chased after something of that nature. Incident number two.  The following week a different neighbor and I went down to Lake Knickerbocker, a small lake that is fed from the creek my other neighbor and I had been fishing on the week before.  We had ridden our bicycles down a small trail that goes from LeDan Road back to the lake.  It was again a sunny afternoon and we had fished for most of the morning without any luck so we had decided to pack it in, as we were headed back out on the trail we heard all these dogs barking and going crazy down the hill just below us near a swampy area on the lake.  We stop to see what was going on.  As we sat there on or bikes we could see the bushes and tall reeds swaying back and forth.  There was a lot of deep grunting sound coming from this area and the dogs were getting more and more intense.  That is when we saw it come out from the reeds, it was massive, hairy from head to toe standing upright like a man, but not a man.  This thing was a good 9 feet tall with hair all matted to its body. Its arms were huge and long with massive hands.  I have never seen anything like this in my life.  It turned toward an open field and started running from the blue tick hounds that were now chasing after it.  As it ran it appeared to be taking what looked like 8 to 9 foot steps from left leg to right leg, it ran upright just like a man swinging its massive arms back and forth, and the dogs didn\\u2019t stand a chance at catching it.  I turned to my friend to say \\u201cdid you see that\\u201d in disbelief but he was already high telling it down the trail headed for home.  So I started after him when the fishing rods that were tied to my bike got caught up in the tree branches.  This is when I made my mistake of hollering for my friend to come back and help me.  As soon as I hollered I noticed that the thing running across the field had heard me too.  It turned and looked straight at me as it ran the rest of the way across the open field and did not look away until it entered the tree line at the other end.  My friend came back and almost broke our rods grabbing them and jerking them free from the trees.  When we got to my house about a half mile away my mom looked at us and asked \\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong boy\\u2019s you look as though you have seen a ghost\\u201d.  Well we told her what we had seen and she just shrugged it off saying \\u201cyou probably saw a bear\\u201d.  But we explained to her that it was no bear as it ran upright just like a man only taking huge strides, and that the dogs had no chance of catching it.  That was the last time I went fishing on either of those water ways. Incident number 3.  This happened the day after my neighbor and I had seen the thing at the lake.  My parents had gone to an office party for the evening leaving me at home with my older sister.  Well she and her boyfriend at the time decided to leave me at home and go see a movie.  So there I was home alone thinking about the events of the last week and a half, it was about 6:30 in the evening and I was freaking myself out.  I didn\\u2019t want to sit there in the house all alone so I got on my bike and started riding up on the street behind my house.  Back then there was a lot of tall grass and bushes between our house and the road behind our house; it runs along under a high power line path, with just a small trail going from our back yard to the road behind our house.  As I road my bike along the road I noticed that when I would get to this one spot there appeared to be something in the tall grass making a loud deep grunting sound.  I looked down that way and could see the grass swaying back and forth but could not see anything else, as I would pass the grunting would stop.  Then when I would turn around and come back by the grunting and swaying would start back up\\u2026. This happened for a couple of passes before I got scared and went and locked myself in the house waiting on my sister to return.  Three days later my friend that had seen the thing down at the lake with me and I were throwing a Frisbee back and forth up on the road near the place I heard the noise.  One of us messed up our throw and the Frisbee went flying down into the grass where the noise had come from.  I told my friend that I was not going to go get it as I thought whatever we had seen down at the lake was down in there the other night.  We both agreed to go down in there together and when we got to the place where I had heard the noises there was this big hole dug out in the ground.  The hole was about 10 foot in diameter and about a foot deep, it looked as though it had been dug out by hand there was also strands of long dark hair all around in the hole.  We got our Frisbee and got out of there quick.  We told our parents about what we had found but they would not go and see for themselves.

January 2007 8 of us went to the barn late at night we heard the sounds the boys had heard and all people and dogs were accounted for inside the barn.

What ever it was jumped out from the woods next to me and grabbed the saddle and back of the horse. As this happened, I jumped off the saddle onto the horses neck, let go of the reins and puit my arms around the horses neck. The horse bolted and ran, I didn't slow down or look back. This thing was face to face with me. I remember the face and hands most of all. It had a HAND- not a paw.the hands were huge will hair on them and long nails. The saddle (an endurance saddle, very light weight without a horn) leather was torn and had deep scratches or gouges in it where the creature had grabbed and pulled at it. It had very human-like features but thicker and scary looking. The hair around his face and neck was very hairy and wirey looking (blackish-brown) with piercing eyes and it had teeth but missing some and all yellow. This thing was massive, standing upright but alittle crouched. I was on a horse that is 16 1/2 hands and was looking it almost straight in the face.

I want to submit this report because reading BFRO report #18707 reminded me of the incedent, and may have been in the same area, \\\"Kinchafoochee Creek\\\". I do not remember the highway number, but it was maybe ten miles out of the town of Albany Ga. Several of us young Marines were stationed at the Base at Albany attending an electronics school at the time. On the weekends, we would sometimes go out to this remote spot in the pine forest/swamp area outside of town. The highway crossed a clear water creek and there was a popular party area off the highway by this bridge where you could park the vehicles and then walk farther back to this area we called Skeeter Beach. We had made a dam and hand dredged the sand and gravel in one particularly nice area of the creek and had made ourselves a very nice little swimming hole. On the night of the incedent, myself and two other Marines had elected to stay the night, as it was already late and we had a nice camp fire going. we finally laid down on blankets and sleeping bags to go to sleep. In the middle of the night one of the other guys woke me up because he heard something big in the woods. I rubbed the sleep out of my eyes and sat up to listen. The third guy also woke up from hearing us talk and we all could hear something very large circling our little camp on the other side of the creek. A feeling of dread overcame us about the size of this thing we heard and we started piling wood on what was left of our fire. As the fire got bigger and bigger and started putting out more light, the animal began backing off from the camp so as to stay just out of the fire light. Whatever it was, it was big! We could hear it walking in a steady crunch-crunch that sounded to me like it was walking on two feet. I am a deer hunter,(bow and arrow), and I know how to vary my steps in the woods so I don't sound like a human. This thing had a steady gait that sounded like a man walking, but much larger. We could hear the muffled breaks of large sticks burried under the forest mat. This was no deer and I don't think it was a bear unless it was walking on two legs. As we got the fire roaring with flames licking about ten feet in the air, the thing finally moved out over the next ridge across the creek so as not to be seen. It was uncanny how the thing was intelegent enough to stay just outside the firelight. It was also uncanny how this thing turned three young Marines into a bunch of fraidy cats about to pee our pants! We never noticed any smell, but the slight breeze was at our backs making the animal downwind from us. We kept the fire pretty big the rest of the night and did not even try to sleep again. At first light, we took the biggest brands out of the fire to use as tourches, put out the fire and walked back along the trails to where our vehicles were parked. When we went back after that night, we always left before dusk and never again attempted to stay the night \", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"Albany Ga.\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"unknown\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Pine forrest lowlands with swampy areas and a very nice clear water stream running through the area with a good current, probably spring fed.\", \"COUNTY\": \"Dougherty County\", \"SEASON\": \"Summer\", \"YEAR\": \"1977\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"Unknown, but I think it was to the North-East of town.\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"About 03:00, very dark, dry cool night.\"},\n",

Fairly heavy traffic was around us too, which I should explain as about 3 cars right around us with about a hundred yard break and then at least 5 to 6 more. The group of cars is where this happened. The group of cars in front of us were approaching a wooded area in the median (which widens even furter at that point, and on either side of the highway was dense woods) at this point something came out of the woods on the right side of the road and sprinted across the road almost right in front of a semi. What was so strange was that this thing seem to clear 2 lanes in 2 steps. At his point I was trying to rationalize why a man would do this and not wait for a break in traffic.

I went outside to put my trash can at the street at about midnight. The only light was the porch lights on the house behind us.  When I walked around the corner of the house, I froze because I saw what looked like something standing at my neighbor's fence. They have a fence that is fenced in on three sides, just not at the front of the house, and what I saw was standing at the back of the fence, I think on my side of the fence, but not sure. All I could see was the silhouette of a person/thing, but it stood 1 1/2 to 2 feet over the top of the fence. All I could see was the silhouette of the shoulders and head and hair sticking up over the fence. It had long hair and it was not really moving.  Only the hair would move. At first I thought it was a person who had stopped and stood still when it saw me.  Then I realized it was way too big to be a person.  I admittedly have bad eyesight though, even with glasses on at night. On top of that I am a logical person with a master's degree, so I don't rush to conclusions, especially fanciful ones.  So I told myself it was just the shadows and light playing tricks on me.  I figured that something was propped up against the fence and just looked like a head and shoulders in the dark and that maybe the hair was some spanish moss caught on whatever it was. But I still felt uneasy and ran inside as fast as I could.  The next day (today) I went outside and looked for whatever it was that might have looked like a head and shoulders. But there as nothing there.  No plants, no trees, nothing propped up against the fence, no spanish moss, just a fence.  We went back outside tonight to look again and see if there was anything casting a funky shadow.  While that corner of the yard is dark and lights barely shine there from the windows, there was definitely nothing taller than the fence and nothing that looked like a head and shoulders. I would estimate, given that the fence is about 6 feet tall, that it was at least 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 feet tall.  It was broad shouldered. And it had long hair or fur on it's head.  I am not saying it was a bigfoot, because I could not see it well enough to say that for certain, but I don't think it was a person. If it was a person it was a very large, very tall, very hairy person.  Also, when I came back inside, my dog (a lab/border collie mix who is about 90 lbs) started growling.  He kept growling until I let him out of his kennel and he immediately ran to my back door.  I let him outside and he shot off.  Our yard is fenced in so he cannot leave the yard.  But ten minutes later when I went to let him back in, he wasn't near the back door. It took several minutes for him to come back to the door after I called repeatedly.  That is not like him.  He usually is begging to come back inside and doesn't hesitate when I call him.

My family and myself dont ever talk about what happened. It happened one evening in the woods in mid November of 2003. My grandfather owns about 4,000 acres in Coweta County. The land consists of a small cabin, some barns, 3 lakes, and lots of off road trails winding and criss crossing everywhere throughout the woods. My father, grandfather, uncle, and 1 cousin hunt the land as much as possible during the hunting season. We had our own 4 wheelers and would depart to our separate tree stands or specific areas to hunt each day. We have all hunted this land for a very long time, since i was 10 years old. Never before have any of us seen, heard ,or even thought about bigfoots being in these woods,ever! My father and I had just purchased a set of 2 way motorola radios to communicate between each other while hunting. well this particular spot i was going to hunt that evening was very deep in the woods in the north east corner of the property. My father and i had scouted this area the day before and we had noticed some strange things. Along the edge of the power line, for about a 20 foot stretch, there were tree limbs, about as round as my wrist, and a good 15-20 foot from the ground, broken and snapped off. There was this rock about thirty feet into the woods from the power line. This huge rock had been recently overturned but the thing was about 4 or 5 feet wide by 3 feet tall. This part of the woods had main power lines running through it which are very favorable to hunt deer on. I had decided that night that if a bear was in this area, I wanted to hunt it. I went there in the morning to set up my stand and scouted the area a little better. We met back at the cabin at 10:00a.m.. My grandfather said that he has never once seen a bear or bear signs of any kind in the 20 plus years hes been hunting in coweta county. He said it sounded ridiculous and that i shouldnt go hunt there by myself, but the thought of being able to bag a bear in these woods was too much! The time came to depart to the evening hunt. My dad told me to keep in touch with the 2 way radios if anything happened and that he would be located about half a mile or more from me. I rode my 4 wheeler down the familiar trails and parked it a couple hundred yards from my newly found hunting destination. As I approached my stand i had put there that morning i noticed a nasty smell in the air, not strong but would catch wiffs of it with the breeze. it smelled like old garbage. I was sitting in the tree stand for a good hour with no action, but the whole time that smell was barely present. My stand was about 40 feet into the woods from the power line near the overturned rock. the power line itself was streched along my left side with the thick woods to my front right and rear. I had a natural path through the woods to the power line, a perfect opening to see anything crossing. i was quietly looking around waiting for a bear to appear when all of a sudden i heard the familiar sound of a deer approaching fast from behind. i looked over my left shoulder to see a doe running through the woods at full pace from the powerline, running fast like something had spooked it. Out of the corner of my eye i saw a flash of movement through the woods along the edge of the power line, just where the doe was running from . i lifted my gun and peered through the scope to try and catch a glimpse of the figure that was making its way along the edge of the powerline. I was hoping it would be my bear and was waiting for it to cross that opening through the woods to the powerline for a clean, clear shot but when the creature/figure stepped into that opening, I saw through the scope that it wasnt a bear but looked human. Just 1 simple stride from this giant thing and it was out of sight of the opening. i was so stunned that i couldnt fire off a shot; besides i thought it was a man. But the thing was very tall, possiblly 8 feet. It had a cinnamon- dark brown hairy looking body. The shoulders were broad and squared and its long arms swung from side to side as it walked at a very fast pace. It happened so fast, i could only get a good look at it for a split second, letting me see enough to know that it wasnt a hunter. After it ran across the opening to the power line i heard a big commotion, starting at the powerline about where that thing should have been and heading into the woods right towards me! I tried to grab the motorola radio to get help from my father but was shaking so bad that i fumbled with it. I quickly lifted my rifle to get ready to blast whatever this big mysterious creature was. 3 more doe came bounding up looking spooked as hell which was the commotion i heard coming my way from the powerline.  The 3 doe ran as fast as they could and outta sight behind my right shoulder. Nothing followed them, nor did i see or hear it again, but that nasty smell still lingered in the air. I called my father on the radio and told him to get over to my spot to get me . I told him I wasnt getting out of the tree stand until he gets there. He came quickly to retrieve me and found me very disturbed. I told him everything that had happened and he didnt know if he believed me or not, but knew i had seen something.\", \"NEAREST_TOWN\": \"newnan\", \"NEAREST_ROAD\": \"highway 85\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Typical georgia woods, thick with hardwood and pine. simple lakes, creeks, marshes, swamps, and small mountains. area of occurence had a powerline clear cut running miles through the woods.\", \"COUNTY\": \"Coweta County\", \"DATE\": \"17\", \"SEASON\": \"Fall\", \"MONTH\": \"November\", \"YEAR\": \"2003\", \"LOCATION_DETAILS\": \"n/a\", \"TIME_AND_CONDITIONS\": \"late afternoon/early evening, hour or so before nightfall. crisp clean and clear weather. semi cold fall hunting season weather\"},\n",

We were driving south on US 441 in an unpopulated area at about 65mph. We were about halfway between Homerville and Fargo  which is slightly west of the Okefenokee Swamp . It was very dark with very scant traffic and we were the only car in sight. There were no other lights visible anywhere and no houses or businesses anywhere around.  My wife had turned on the map light because we were getting low on gas and we needed to check the distance to the nearest probable area for gas. She was looking down at the map and didn't see it,  but she  sure smelled it.  Years before , we had been camping in the Okefenokee Swamp and were aware of the wildlife diversity. I have hunting , camping , and Brazilian jungle experience and I am not easily frightened, but this shook me up.   It was an instinctive reaction similar to when you have a surprise encounter with a poisonous snake. I saw a very dark brown/black constant colored tall humanoid figure standing on the left shoulder of the road , quarter facing toward the road and toward the direction of our travel. The figure was standing still,  very vertically erect with both arms loosely down at its sides. I couldn't see any facial features or individual features of hands or feet. I estimate it to be about 7 ft. tall and weigh between 200 and 300 pounds. It was lanky rather than stocky and was not crouching forward , but was standing very vertical. The smell coming into the car vent was very powerfull and was a combination of sewerlike and a strong musky animal odor. There was a small animal roadkill a few yards down the highway that was fresh , so that wouldn't account for the fowl odor. We conjectured that the creature had smelled the roadkill and came out of the woods to investigate. The hair on the head was long and stringy, but the rest of the body hair seemed only two or three inches long and layed down rather than sticking out in a fuzzy fashion. The thing that struck me was that I couldn't see any facial features or varied colors around the hand areas. We thought about turning around to re- investigate,  but in the middle of the night , I frankly didn't think it was prudent.  We proceeded to the next major intersection to buy gas, and I asked the station employees if anyone else had mentioned something unusual or if there were any kind of unusual wildlife sightings in the area. They answered \\\"no\\\".  That was the end of our incident. All but one of the sketches I have ever seen of creatures anything like this , showed a more stocky crouching ape-like creature. What I saw was a tall, lanky , humanoid  creature that looked almost \\\"helmeted\\\" because of the way the head hair fell straight down similar to a woman with long straight hair. I could see no neck .

      "{\"REPORT_NUMBER\": \"9712\", \"REPORT_CLASS\": \"Class A\", \"OTHER_WITNESSES\": \"Me and my father - but on separate incidences.\", \"ENVIRONMENT\": \"Many many pine trees and woods and a lake w/ many cows.\", \"A_&_G_References\": \"DeLorme 5.0\", \"STATE\": \"Georgia\", \"OBSERVED\": \"I am now 33 years old. At the time that I encountered this creature, I was 13. I will write it as it happeded. Me and my family lived in a rural community on the outskirts of Riverdale Ga. Behind our house there was many acres of woods. At that time that area belonged to  a man named Mr. Jackson. There was a huge lake there also, it was called Jackson's Lake. Mr. Jackson was a cattle farmer. His cattle were on the other side of the lake. There were many trails in those woods and me and my friend Daniel played in them many, many times. It was very easy to loose yourself out there all day. My encounter happened when I walked through these woods to a trailer park that was called Chatue Manner. The trailer park still exists today but is under a different name. I went to visit a friend. I started to notice that it was getting late, and my father had told me that he did not want me in those woods after dark.  This struck me and mother as strange, because we would always be in the woods. My mom would even go in those woods to pick blackberrys. At any rate I decided to obey my father - as I did not want to hear his mouth. I walked to the back of the trailer park and there you have to cross a big raveen. It is like 10-15 ft. down and then up again. I was covered in vegetation and that Georgia red clay. Down in the raveen was a creek, so you would get a little scuffed up. After I crossed that I went up a trail that went up hill by the lake and that curved around and led to my house. After passing the lake, and turing the curve I encountered my father. He said \\\"What are you doing out here?\\\" I said I was just coming back from Pam's house. He said \\\"Well hurry up and get home\\\". I left him standing there and started for home. I turned back to see what he was doing and he was walking toward the lake. I just kept walking toward my house - when on my right side I heard rustling in the foliage beside me. The foliage was mostly dense tall pine trees with all kinds of honey suckles and black berry vines and muscidine vines. That was the place where me and mom would come to pick blackberrys. I tured and looked and I saw this creature. This thing was massive. I could see him. He was only a few feet away from me. He stood parallel to me.  I was heading north to my house. He too was faced north. I was on a heavily walked clear trail, whereas he was in the shrubs. These little pine trees were taller than him. He was at least 7-8 feet tall. His arms were huge, like the size of thighs, they were very long. His chest was massive as well. This was no skinny creature. I looked at him. He looked at me, and off, off, off, I went running up the trail. I was so scared!!! When I started to run, he did too. He ran right beside me in the shrubs. I would look to my right and see him and the thing would make a loud sound.  It's like he would exhale and let out a very deep grunt/roar.  I kept running and he kept running beside me in the shrubs. This thing was completly hairy and it's face was dark but I could tell it was human-like because its head was like that of a human head but hair all over - but not on the face. When I had reached the part of the trail that forked off into an open field of tall grass/wheat like stuff, that is where he stopped. He would not come out of the shrubery. I looked back and seen him crouched there staring at me as I ran and he just was there in the shrubbery. When I made it home I ran in the house shaking like a leaf, and my mom was making supper. I told her what had happened and what I had seen. And she went to look out the dinning glass window. It was a sliding glass window and she said she did'nt see anything. She asked where my father was and I told her. Then she sat down with me at the dining room table and told me that was the reason that he did not want me in those woods. She said that he had told her that he had hemmed it up in a tree one night and that he just stood there in front of it and screamed at it and it would'nt come out of the tree. I never told anyone other than my mother and Daniel and now my 4 boys about that. But there was something in those woods and me and my father werent the only ones that knew it. One day I was watching TV after school (this was before any of this happened) and my father come in and told me to come and help him. I said why? Me and my father DO NOT get along very well. He said because Benji, our dog had got caught in a bear trap on the other side of the lake. I said \\\"WHAT?\\\" He said yes. So we went and tried to free benji and my father had took a macheti. He said he could not open the trap, so he was going to cut his foot off. I said NO!! So I pulled the trap w/ all my might and my father got benji out. Now why had someone set a Bear Trap in the woods? There are no bears in Georgia. The biggest animal besides that Thing I had seen were deer and cows. And the cows were on the other side of the lake, they could not come across one side because of trees and the other side because of a big steel fence. And other times before I had ever encountered this being, Me and my family would go walking in the woods and sometimes we would cross the steel gate over to Mr. Jackson's land and treck about a mile to a very sandy clear creek. That was the side where the cows were. On many different occasions we would come upon a cow laying on the ground dead with its whole stomach torn out. That was very weird to me, but because I was young and did'nt know much and since my parents did'nt say much I never put 2+2 together until my later 20's. There was something in those woods but it's probly long gone by now. There are houses all around that lake and Mr. Jackson no longer lives in his house. The creek where these things happened is called Camp Creek. The lake was called Jackson's Lake. It was private to him. Although me and Daniel would always play around the woods and the lake. The name of the street was and is Lyle Dr. The town Riverdale Ga. I will never forget when that creature chased me but when I got to that opening I knew that he didnt want to hurt me. Because I know by his massive size and that massive sound that he could have just ripped me apart had he wanted to. Needless to say that I did'nt go in the woods much after that.

By 1600 hrs it was too cold to stay out. Our lab was coming out of the water with ice coating her. We returned to camp and had a warm fire going, ate an early supper, and retired early. It was too cold to sit up. At aproximately 2200 hrs I awaken to our lab growling softly. Jim was awake too. He asked me, \\\"Robbie, is your gun loaded?\\\" I assured him it was. We then heard a two legged creature walking toward our tent from the rear. I say a two legged creature because Men walk differently from deer. At that time there were no deer, or hogs on Little Tybee, Although now there are. The creature stopped aproximately 30 to 40 feet from our tent.(Our tent was in a small valley, and wouldnt be visible to someone coming from the backside of the Island unil they were upon it.)There was a minute or two of complete silence. Even my Lab was extremely quiet, she acted scared for the first time I had ever seen. There was then a whooshing sound of something large whirling through the air, it struck out tent with a tremendous whump. The dog went nuts. We both unassed the tent with our six volt headlights on and our shotguns at port arms. I caught a glimpse of something very dark colored and man sized running towards the backside of the Island. I noticed an odor tha I can only describe as a cross between grey fox and civit cat, in the air. We ran after it out to the edge of the open marsh. It clearly coul run faster without lights than we could with lights. I never got close enough for a positive visual.There is nothing on the backside of Little Tybee, except miles on open salt marsh, tidal rivers and creeks,and dozens of smaller hammocks and small islands. No man could or would hav exposed himself to that marsh in those temperatures. The marsh itself was frozen hard, but the creeks wern't. Under those conditions a man would perish in minutes if he got wet in salt water. We checked the only other boat landing on the island, the creek intrance on the northeastern end of the island. There was no boat or evidence of one being there. We walked the entire beach looking for prints, or other boats, and we were the only boat on the beach. We discussed the incident awhile and concluded that we just may have had a sasquatch encounter.

The incidents began in the fall of 2004. It started out as hearing strange howling sounds in the evening. I never heard the vocalizations in the day time.  In the fall of 2004 some friends and I went camping on my driveway. It was the middle of October, and around 2 in the morning I heard a loud grunting sound and trees snapping. The noises were so loud that they woke me up. It was a full moon that night and clear, and when I opened the window on the tent I could not believe what I was seeing. I saw a large dark figure with eyes that seemed to illuminate red in the moonlight. It was beating something in the head which I found to be a deer come sun up. The creature drug the deer up to the top of the hill above the camp sight. It walked up on top of some big rocks and I could make it out perfectly. 8 to 10 feet tall and covered in hair. The one friend who stayed the evening saw the exact same thing. I watched it eat the deer. It pulled off appendages like it was nothing. Shortly after it started eating it noticed our tent. It walked right down to the side of the tent, and the smell coming off of it was intensely musky. It knocked the frying pan out of the tree by the tent as it was walking by, and when it hit the ground, it ran back to the top of the hill. The deer carcass was gone, but hair and intestines were left behind. The liver, spleen, heart and lungs must have been eaten. We followed the drag marks from the carcass and found a mass of pine trees bent and broken into some form of shelter. I have many other encounters that I can share. They are real and they are here. I have had rocks thrown at me, and I have been charged by one twice. I barely got inside the house both times. They do not like light, and they do not like it if you shine a light directly at them.

I only hear them in fall and winter though. I am also a hunter, and when I was hearing the Squatches every night, there was not a deer to be found. When I did see deer they were very jumpy. This was during archery season that I made this observation, therefore no gun shots were occurring to spook them. I promise you from the bottom of my heart that they are real.

I heard a loud clomping sound coming toward us on the other side of the gulley, swishing thru the small pines coming down the path toward us.  I thought it was a mule that had gotten out and I would try to catch it. That is how loud it sounded as it came toward us. When it came up on our side of the gulley I saw a large ape/man like hairy creature jogging toward us on the path on two legs. Needless to say my friend and I didn't stay around for an extended look, maybe two to three seconds of observation then we took off. The creature was probably close to six/seven feet tall. It looked like that video [Patterson-Gimlin film]. When we told our parents and playmates we were the subject of much ridicule, that is until about a week or so later when five or so of them were down at the creek damming it up. I wasn't with them as I no longer played in the woods. Well they saw the thing, this was the middle of the day, as they came running out of the woods, some of them crying they were so shaken.
